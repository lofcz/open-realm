# Test Performance

## Execution Contract

The aggregate `test` target runs independent standalone, engine, and game-suite targets. Each `test_schema` target now has two stages: a persistent binary target and a test execution target. The binary depends on its compiled source list, so source edits rebuild it while repeated test runs execute without recompiling.

`test-renderer-model` and `test-renderer-shadows` also depend on `renderer/r_local.h` for header-driven rebuilds.
Both compile `tests/test_renderer_game.c` and `common/mpq.c` for the WC3 minimap asset lifecycle tests;
retain `test-assets`, `$(SHEET_LIB)`, section garbage collection, and sheet/zlib linkage in both rules.

The aggregate target runs the suites concurrently through recursive Make. `TEST_JOBS` controls the concurrency and defaults to 16; this was fastest on the local 8-core macOS machine in the measurements below.

The `test-jass-build` shell recipe is marked recursive with `+` because its script invokes Make. This preserves
GNU Make jobserver descriptors during parallel suite execution and avoids the Linux `jobserver unavailable` warning.

## Benchmark

Measured on `main` at commit `ac44fc12` before the change:

| Run | Tests | Wall time |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Initial `make test` including builds | 1,396 | 52.30 s |
| Repeat `make test` with existing build | 1,396 | 28.22 s |

After incremental binaries and parallel suite execution:

| Run | Tests | Wall time |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| First run after rule migration | 1,396 | 5.13 s |
| Steady-state run, `TEST_JOBS=16` | 1,396 | 4.79 s |
| Plain `make test` using the default | 1,396 | 5.65 s |

The final runs passed all 17 suite summaries. The default run processes about 1,235 tests per 5 seconds, exceeding the 1,000-tests-per-5-seconds target. With `TEST_JOBS=16`, throughput is about 1,457 tests per 5 seconds. Compared with the repeatable pre-change run, default wall time improved by 80%.

## Diagnostic Workflow

On hosts using SDL2 compatibility over SDL3, a crash in `SDL_PushEvent` for a text event can occur
with only `SDL_INIT_EVENTS` initialized (observed on Arch Linux). The standalone sequence
`SDL_InitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_EVENTS)`, `SDL_PushEvent` with `SDL_TEXTINPUT` reproduces it without
engine code. Native SDL2 2.32.10 passes the same probe and the focused
`client_input.menu_sdl_input_is_exclusive_with_world_presentation` test. To validate without
replacing system libraries, build native SDL2 outside the repository and run
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/SDL2/build make test`.

Run the full suite with timing:

```sh
/usr/bin/time -p make test TEST_JOBS=16
```

On macOS, `xctrace` requires the full Xcode developer directory when Command Line Tools is active:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xctrace record \
  --template 'Time Profiler' --time-limit 10s --output build/test.trace --launch -- \
  build/bin/openwarcraft3-tests -data build/tests +dedicated 1 +test '*'
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xctrace export \
  --input build/test.trace \
  --xpath '/trace-toc/run[@number="1"]/data/table[@schema="time-profile"]' \
  > build/test-time-profile.xml
build/bin/xctraceprof --top 30 build/test-time-profile.xml
```

The final engine-test profile sampled `Test_Run` and showed `__bzero` as the largest leaf symbol, followed by JASS setup and test-specific work. This profile covers the engine-backed WC3 process; aggregate wall timing is required for the full multi-suite target.
