# Warcraft III guard position and Stop return

## Implemented contract

OpenRealm distinguishes the player's Stop guard point from Hold Position.

- Stop captures the unit's current world position as its guard position.
- Ordinary idle acquisition after Stop is a temporary guard-combat detour. The unit may chase and fight normally.
- When that automatic combat ends, and no explicit Shift-queued order is waiting, the unit returns to the remembered guard position through the ordinary point-Move path.
- Arrival uses the existing Move completion/tolerance rules; guard return does not introduce another pathfinder or magic arrival radius.
- After the return Move completes, the unit resumes ordinary stopped/idle behavior and can acquire again.
- A newer explicit behavior order clears the old player Stop guard point, including Move, Attack, Smart, and Harvest. It therefore cannot reassert after the newer order later completes.
- A queued player order outranks guard return. Combat completion advances the FIFO instead of starting the internal return.
- A second Stop captures the unit's then-current position as the new guard point.
- Hold Position is separate: it suppresses automatic translation and does not use a return-to-anchor journey.

Guard return is internal default AI behavior rather than a player FIFO entry. This keeps the priority order:

```text
current explicit order
    > queued explicit orders
    > automatic combat detour
    > Stop guard return
    > ordinary idle acquisition
```

## State ownership

The authoritative state lives on the unit movement state:

```text
guard_position
guard_position
guard_state: NONE, IDLE, COMBAT, or RETURNING
```

`guard_state` is `NONE` without an anchor, `IDLE` while a stopped unit may acquire normally, `COMBAT` during an automatic combat detour, and `RETURNING` while the internal return Move is active. Explicit Attack and persistent parent behaviors such as Patrol, Attack-Move, and Follow keep their existing completion/resume rules and do not use Stop guard return.

The Move path changes `RETURNING` back to `IDLE` on arrival or its normal near-goal settle edge, then installs the ordinary stand state. While that Move is active, normal idle acquisition is not running.

## Explicit-order replacement

The player Stop guard point is deliberately conservative: an explicit point/target replacement clears it instead of assuming every Move destination automatically becomes a new retail guard point. Pressing Stop at the desired location establishes a new point.

This prevents an old Stop location from unexpectedly taking control after a later explicit Move or Attack completes.

## Retail guard-system follow-up

Warcraft also exposes a broader AI/creep guard-position system (`SetUnitCreepGuard`, `RemoveGuardPosition`, `RecycleGuardPosition`) and neutral-creep leash constants such as GuardDistance, MaxGuardDistance, and GuardReturnTime. Those behaviors are related but are not folded into this player Stop patch:

- `RemoveGuardPosition` and `RecycleGuardPosition` are still JASS placeholders in OpenRealm.
- `SetUnitCreepGuard` is declared by `common.txt` but does not yet have a native implementation here.
- Attack-owned neutral mobile guard polling and return now use authored GuardDistance/GuardReturnTime and an independent primary request. Move replacement retains this timer; arrival reevaluates it. See [the original timer producer and exact movement replay](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#attack-guard-timers-restart-neutral-movement-payoff254).
- MaxGuardDistance, damage-timestamp, early global gates and broader creep/JASS policy remain unimplemented; the bounded timer port does not establish those contracts.
- forced relocation does not rewrite a generic retail creep guard point, whereas Hold Position remains a non-anchor policy. Keep those systems separate.

Implement the broader creep/JASS guard layer as a follow-up on top of the shared guard-return movement primitive rather than changing Stop semantics again.
