# Retail pathfinding: executable research backlog

Target: Warcraft III **1.27.1.7085**. [Behavior ledger][ledger] owns the
contracts and evidence limits; this file owns the work queue. Complete the
research before declaring the full faithful OpenRealm replacement. Independently
verified slices can be integrated earlier; the [scalar/turn integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md)
has exact C/live evidence without closing the whole-replacement READY gates.

## Progress

Architecture follow-up (runtime308–310): ordered constructor stages, stable
versioned type definitions, shared immutable attack defaults with owned overrides,
prepared initialization plans and bounded ordered fog checkpoints are implemented.
The constructor trace and full Classic/TFT suites pass; final IceCrown
position/member/RNG records still match source221. Raw creation remains
8.48–8.98 ms and rendered deadlines still fail. The fog A/B does not establish a
speedup. These changes close no retail fidelity TODOs; see
[architecture and performance gate](performance.md#october-5-constructor-definitions-and-ordered-fog-checkpoints).

Runtime318 follow-up replaces cached fog cell replay and cold rim rectangle
scans with ordered word masks and a shared blocker index. Raw IceCrown creation
is 8.098037 ms; final positions, member state and RNG still exactly match
source221. A runtime316/317 pair reduces first fog update CPU from 99.38 to
58.26 ms, but the subsequent runtime318 rendered capture regresses across the
pipeline and still fails deadlines. The final same-window pair confirms a local
fog reduction (81.90 → 68.35 ms first update) without a total-server win. The full
repository suite passes, including 2,630 tests / 7,075,879 assertions per data mode.
No frame-rate acceptance or retail TODO closure is claimed. See [direct geometry evidence](performance.md#october-5-direct-fog-geometry-and-ordered-words)
and the detailed fog capture ledger.

Runtime320–324 replaces repeated fog-ray arithmetic with shared immutable rows
and transparent spans, and repeated server neighborhood scans with a hierarchical
spatial hash that restores exact Quake encounter order. Connected-viewer fog
median falls 14.91 → 4.14 ms; a same-game-library server pair reduces mean entity
update CPU 36.30 → 26.04 ms. Runtime324 raw creation is 8.254482 ms with the full
source221 final record unchanged. The rendered maximum is still 94.24 ms: the
creation and presentation targets remain unmet. Full repository validation
passes (2,633 tests / 7,093,714 assertions per Classic/TFT mode). These are engine improvements,
not retail task closures. See [architecture and evidence](performance.md#october-5-shared-fog-rays-and-ordered-spatial-hashing).

October 5 performance follow-up: source297 creates 4,096 units synchronously on
IceCrown in 8.208 ms CPU, including first-unit resources. Full final positions,
member state and RNG match source221. This remains above the 2 ms target.
Enemy-presence rejection, mine owner lookup, sparse rally cleanup and dirty
shared-controller command-card checks remove repeated unrelated entity scans.
Source298 passes the full repository suite, including Classic/TFT engine tests
(2,623 tests / 6,869,578 assertions each), index restoration and 604 pathfinding
Python checks. Complete source297 actual-swap captures reduce median active
server CPU from 58.689 ms to 46.021 ms, but still fail the frame budget: peak
160.651 ms and 20 double-period gaps. Per-source sight reuse/local blocker
invalidation, ordered lifecycle plans, resource caches, partial model reads,
archive hash indexing and sparse status/order storage remain implemented.
Metadata cache-miss splitting and a compact area-list experiment were reverted
because they did not establish an overall performance win. This performance
work closes no additional retail research tasks. See
[performance evidence](performance.md#october-5-synchronous-creation-follow-up).

**285 done / 336 tasks; 51 remaining.**

Payoff263 closes ORDER-02.3 by integrating generic queued activation and failed-successor dispatch. Retail fixtures remain unchanged; new repeated original/control traces supply the added contract.
Payoff262 fixes explicit Attack/AttackOnce availability suppression with saved
owner state. Stop and Attack Move release it; queued/rejected commands retain
the executing policy. GROUP-03.2 stays open for full ranking and wider guards.
See [Attack subscriptions](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#explicit-attack-owns-availability-suppression-payoff262).

Payoff261 closes SCHED-01.2: exact clock rollover, backward UI-load continuation
and independent path FIFO timing are verified through existing public retail
captures plus a new original-code/production saved-suffix regression. Existing
runtime behavior and valid expectations are retained; no new runtime fix is
claimed. See [clock rollover](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#clock-rollover-preserves-path-admission-state-payoff261).

Payoff260 integrates the owner-change target-availability producer: ordered
nearby Attack acquisition, committed-range admission and speed-cap exemption
preserve explicit Move and public heads. Two original repeats, an unhooked
control and failing-first engine regressions retain existing expectations.
GROUP-03.2 remains open for complete ranking/guards and broader domains. See
[target availability](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-availability-reaches-nearby-attack-subscribers-payoff260).

Payoff259 closes NUM-01.15 with the original16-state numeric DFA, repeated
actual source compilation and engine JASS/Move regressions. Invalid octals now
fail compilation; declared nan/inf/Infinity remain identifiers. Scalar and
movement fixture expectations remain unchanged; Galaxy retains its own mode.
See [numeric source boundaries](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#jass-numeric-source-boundaries-precede-scalar-conversion-payoff259).

Payoff258 separates public structure Stop admission from internal null-callback
support recovery, preserving task cancellation and path invalidation. Repeated
retail four-form traces and an unhooked control confirm current-form gating and
three mobile Ancient footprint regions; blocked-terrain/cold-save and actual
Root regressions cover the engine. MAP-04.2 retains its wider compositions.
See [structure Stop](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#stop-recovery-follows-the-current-structure-form-payoff258).

Payoff257 integrates the independent nonstructure unit exclusion around Stop
and replacement Move recovery, including all footprint regions. Two original
read-only repeats preserve prior motion and scope expectations; actual engine
footprint/save regressions cover caller depths0/3. MAP-04.2 retains its wider
compositions. See [unit Stop scopes](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#unit-stop-excludes-its-footprint-regions-payoff257).
Payoff256 closes TARGET-03.2 by joining all17 frozen loss policies and5
reacquisition policies to production owner regressions. Paused point commands
now create their fresh physical group on delayed resume, as both original
captures show. Added shared-fog, paused-target, fade/reissue and five saved
reacquisition compositions retain existing retail expectations. See
[target policy closure](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#complete-listed-target-loss-and-reacquisition-policies-payoff256).
Payoff255 preserves periodic guard request identity and serials across inside
polls, late draining and cold save. Two original event-clock traces retain all
earlier trajectory words and show canceled requests popping silently. This fixes
tied-cohort ordering without another pathfinder or new task split. See
[periodic guard identity](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#periodic-guard-request-identity-payoff255).
Payoff254 identifies and ports the Attack-owned neutral guard timer behind the
previously excluded point-task restart. Two final read-only retail repeats and an
unhooked control retain all618/624 original trajectory rows; engine replay and
cold-save suffix now match through1723. Authored tuning, lifecycle cleanup and
Save165 pass without changing frozen expectations. TARGET-03.2 remains open for
wider policy compositions. See [guard timers](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#attack-guard-timers-restart-neutral-movement-payoff254).
Payoff253 implements all six point/location fog query natives with constant-time
completed-plane reads and original calling-client/neutral policy. Two retail
repeats and an unhooked control preserve32 public markers; engine cold-save replay
and256 original-code classifications pass. Existing fixtures and same-turn reveal
expectations remain unchanged. TARGET-03.2 retains broader geometry/policies and
the independent point-task restart. See [public fog queries](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#public-point-and-location-fog-queries-payoff253).
Payoff252 fixes early fog reacquisition through the ordered primary fog event
and saves completed visibility/exploration with its deadline and serial. Exact
bounded retail replay and cold-save regressions retain all original fixture words.
TARGET-03.2 remains open for broader policies and the separately exposed native
point-task restart. See [fog publication](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#authoritative-fog-publication-and-reacquisition-payoff252).
Payoff251 closes TARGET-03.1: original visibility-policy matrix and lifecycle
producer mapping, preserved reachable branch table, named shared engine query
and self/hidden/dead optional Move normalization with immediate/Shift/save
regressions. Wider TARGET-03.2 stays open. See
[visibility policy and admission](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#visibility-policies-and-optional-target-admission-payoff251).
Payoff250 moves selected queued point notification to head activation before
Move task creation. Four read-only retail repeats, saved Ghidra mapping and
failing-first movement/save/JASS callback regressions cover same-point replacement
and instant Stop. Existing retail expectations are preserved; previously excluded
engine-only enqueue counters are corrected. ORDER-02.2/02.3 and
GROUP-04.6 retain their broader owners/controls. See [activation before tasks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#queued-point-events-precede-internal-task-construction-payoff250).
Payoff249 replaces delayed queued physical reconstruction with canonical
pending attachments and readiness scopes. Inherited owners remain until source
readiness; old rows retire during normal preparation and survive save/removal.
Two retail repeats,48 native cases/48 controls and failing-first engine
regressions retain earlier partition/motion expectations. GROUP-04.6/MAP-04.2
remain open for wider owners and event boundaries. See
[queued reconstruction](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#queued-reconstruction-keeps-inherited-owners-until-source-readiness-payoff249).

Payoff248 separates selected canonical attachments/readiness from physical
cohorts, removes premature physical binding and holds pending fine exclusions
through busy/success publication. Failing-first engine checks, two read-only
retail repeats and complete native depth/drop controls preserve old fixtures.
GROUP-04.6/MAP-04.2 remain open for their wider owners and event/save boundaries.
See [canonical request publication](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#canonical-point-requests-publish-physical-cohorts-only-at-readiness-payoff248).

Payoff247 integrates05ca50 bridge ownership across motion cancellation, embedded
recovery and path invalidation, before public Stop stand/replacement Move. New
public regressions,32 complete original cases/controls and repeated live nested
counters retain old retail expectations. MAP-04.2 remains open for canonical
group publication and the independent unit/notification scopes. See
[bridge Stop recovery](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#bridge-stop-owns-cancellation-and-embedded-recovery-payoff247).

Payoff246 removes target-goal world round trips with canonical fine group
storage and exact routing keys. Two retail repeats/control and captured-sample
cold-save regressions preserve the numerical contract. TARGET-02.1 remains
open for its broader coverage. See [fine group destinations](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#physical-groups-retain-exact-fine-destinations-payoff246).
Payoff245 closes FORM-01.3: the policy-producer inventory now has integrated
coverage, including sentinel target owners that turn without route searches.
Repeated retail/control captures, a complete original facing oracle and engine
fresh/cold-save regressions retain literal retail expectations. Wider Attack
timing remains TARGET/ORDER scope. See [sentinel requests](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#sentinel-target-requests-turn-before-attacking-payoff245).
Payoff244 fixes file-backed footprint axes and category decoding, with complete
mixed Alt+Shift trajectories and cold-save continuations against frozen retail
commits. Existing bridge masks and world-space expectations are preserved.
GROUP-04.6 retains wider ownership work; no task closure is claimed. See
[file-backed footprints](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#file-backed-footprints-preserve-retail-axes-and-categories-payoff244).
Payoff243 fixes mixed busy/idle Shift admission: idle recipients retain prepared
class policy and attachment order; later busy activation reconstructs policy0.
Four complete retail captures and cold-save regressions accompany the engine
change. GROUP-04.6 remains open; see [prepared idle admission](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#idle-shift-recipients-retain-the-prepared-packet-policy).
Payoff242 fixes missing pending-command identities in selected priority counts:
ordinary queue admission resolves IDs once, optional payloads remain supported,
and total-head counting is constant time. Repeated actual Shift/replacement
retail rows and failing-first queue/Patrol/save regressions accompany the fix.
ORDER-02.2/02.3 retain broader control ownership work. See
[pending user identities](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#pending-user-heads-retain-their-matching-identities-payoff242).

Payoff241 integrates retail selected admission priorities while retaining canonical
attachment membership.198 original comparator pairs, six actual UI packets and
failing-first callback/publication regressions accompany exact point-score and
queue/save checks. GROUP-04.6 retains wider canonical lifetime and priority-owner
work. See [selected admission priority](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#selected-admission-priority-preserves-attachment-membership-payoff241).

Payoff240 replaces the mixed FLOAT legacy fallback with up to three prepared
request classes, preserving clicked points, independent history and queue/save
ownership.48 complete original readiness scopes and repeated actual UI affinity
witnesses accompany the failing-first engine fix. GROUP-04.6 retains the full
sorted admission/callback sequence and wider lifetime work. See
[selected FLOAT requests](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#selected-float-candidates-retain-their-own-request-payoff240).

Payoff239 closes GROUP-01.1's representative selected/JASS/AI producer inventory
and fixes stale shared history when a player singleton replaces a shared order.
Repeated retail publication evidence, failing-first queue/save regressions and
unchanged independent/Captain contracts accompany the fix. See
[player singleton history](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#player-singleton-publication-clears-shared-history-payoff239).

Payoff238 gives Alt current flyers independent request/history owners while
preserving global candidate admission and last-ready physical publication order.
Complete original class/grounding cases, frozen public repeats and engine
selection/queue/save/callback regressions accompany the fix. GROUP-04.6 retains
FLOAT and wider canonical lifetime work. See
[Alt request publication](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#alt-flight-requests-publish-independently-in-candidate-order-payoff238).

Payoff237 routes ordinary ground/flying selections through one primary request,
correcting the mistaken FLOAT/flight classification. Complete original attachment
cases, ordinary/Alt retail repeats and failing-first selected order/save tests
accompany the fix. GROUP-04.6 retains Alt/FLOAT producer and canonical lifetime
work. See [mixed selections](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#ordinary-ground-and-flight-selections-share-the-primary-request-payoff237).

Payoff236 repartitions inherited queued members after source readiness using
retail's ordinary ordered distance predicate. Complete original callback/factory
cases, repeated pending/source-ready observations and production queue/save
regressions accompany the fix. GROUP-04.6 retains canonical lifetime work. See
[queued repartition](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#queued-activation-repartitions-inherited-members-payoff236).

Payoff235 partitions ready members with retail's ordered transitive distance
rule and independent physical owners, preserving shared request identity and
parameters. Complete original cases, repeated public/control captures and
failing-first engine order/save regressions accompany the change. GROUP-04.6
retains unresolved canonical lifetime work. See
[ready-member partition](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#ready-members-partition-by-ordered-connectivity-payoff235).

Payoff234 retains retail's one-point disabled group-route cache and destination,
with no coarse search/admission. Repeated genuine flight-rebind/control captures,
36 complete original table cases and public group/save regressions cover the
fix. GROUP-04.6 stays open. See
[disabled group routes](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#disabled-group-routing-retains-a-real-cache-payoff234).

Payoff233 integrates preferred adaptive-enabled route sources, strict predicted
distance ties and the group bypass origin using existing saved unit policy.
Repeated retail flight-rebind/control evidence and failing public order/save
regressions pass; GROUP-04.6 retains broader owner work. See
[route source selection](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#route-sources-prefer-adaptive-enabled-members-payoff233).

Payoff232 replaces queued activation's whole-group scan with the original ordered
center-circle query and first-compatible-owner stop. It preserves all established
retail motion fixtures; GROUP-04.6 stays open for its wider producer/owner work.
See [queued cohort acquisition](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md).

Payoff231 advances MAP-04.2: public terrain queries now preserve raw identity
traversal and saved query/object stamps through the shared endpoint cell query.
600 complete original scopes and two48-query live repeats/control match;
group-publication/outer recovery scopes remain open. See
[point-query history](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#public-point-queries-retain-raw-spatial-history-payoff231).

Payoff230 advances MAP-04.2: widget regions now retain original authored bounds
through publication/save reconstruction, and captain reachability excludes and
restores both first widget rectangles in retail order. Complete original query
exits and96 bounds cases pass; group/point scopes keep the task open. See
[widget distance scopes](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#widget-bounds-and-captain-distance-scopes-payoff230).

Payoff229 closes MAP-02.2: shared rigid walkable geometry now drives unit and
JASS support. The combined cliff/water/LT06 fixture preserves all4096 authored
cells and matches all40 frozen movement-lane heights/source flags word-exactly.
Two read-only captures retain383 distinct mesh queries; original triangle,
transform and sphere kernels supply2867 exact cases. See
[authoritative walkable meshes](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authoritative-rigid-walkable-meshes-payoff229).

Payoff228 integrates the shared map-start flyer support field, exact SSE
interpolation/max/average order, authored water-decimal conversion and saved
field history. Two retail repeats/control retain the existing193 public markers;
627 live samples and the full64-word engine grid match. MAP-02.2 remains open
for mesh support and the remaining widget producers. See
[flyer support](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-map-start-flyer-support-field-payoff228).


Payoff227 integrates counted inside-construction absence/work ownership,
scripted pause independence, and distinct KillUnit/completion versus RemoveUnit
inverses. Two complete native repeats and an unhooked control freeze72 policy,
pause/hidden and depth phases; Classic/TFT engine save/owner/order regressions
pass. Remaining counted producers keep SEP-01.2 open. See
[inside construction](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#inside-construction-owns-absence-and-work-separately-payoff227).



Payoff226 integrates primary Human construction's separation work phase,
ordinary Repair's distinct eligibility and the shared inverse across pause,
Stop, replacement Move, target retirement and cold saves. Repeated original
captures freeze24 policy phases; broader counted suppression keeps SEP-01.2
open. See [primary construction work](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#primary-human-construction-owns-separation-suppression-payoff226).



Payoff225 integrates Hero agility into default and mutable movement speeds,
retaining cached contribution deltas across public speed overrides, item edits,
level changes and cold saves. Nine original repeat/control captures freeze
fractional scalar words; no prior retail expectation changes. Broader MOVE-01.1
remains open and no new TODO is added.
See [Hero movement deltas](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#hero-agility-publishes-movement-deltas-payoff225).

Payoff224 fixes Attack Blink loss: committed-center retention range, near-chase
retention and far-target release without ordinary point recovery. Repeated
retail/control evidence and failing-first engine regressions preserve existing
fixtures. Wider TARGET-03.2 remains open; no new TODO is added.
See [Attack Blink policy](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#attack-blink-loss-uses-committed-range-and-excludes-point-recovery-payoff224).

Payoff223 adds independent indexed Attack TargetLost subscriptions and physical
point recovery while retaining the public Attack head/FIFO. Controlled original
invisibility/detection, hide, death and removal repeats match an unhooked control;
engine cold-save, nested-delivery, Stop, Cyclone and replacement regressions pass.
No prior retail expectation changes; wider TARGET-03.2 remains open.
See [Attack point recovery](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#attack-targetlost-retains-a-point-recovery-task-payoff223).

Payoff222 delegates Attack ground-unit chases to nonpersistent physical target
groups, retaining combat parents and cached fog samples through cold saves.
Original repeated/control evidence proves hidden-arrival validation and short-fog
continuation; target samples keep their fine coordinates near map edges.
Broader TARGET-03.2 remains open; no prior retail expectation is rewritten.
See [physical Attack chases](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#attack-chases-use-physical-target-groups-payoff222).

Payoff221 integrates target owner-change delivery separately from TargetLost.
Repeated retail captures prove persistent Follow completion and Smart approach
continuation, including same-owner and paused controls. Public native/save
regressions pass without modifying prior expectations; broader TARGET-03.2 stays
open. See [owner-change recovery](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-owner-changes-recover-the-current-task-before-returning-payoff221).

Payoff220 integrates queued target Move fallback after issue-time-visible units
become invisible, dead, removed or fogged before activation. Two genuine Shift
retail repeats and an unhooked control preserve packet points and913 public
markers; failing-first engine/save regressions cover slot reuse and widget
boundaries. Wider TARGET-03.1/03.2 remain open. See
[queued target fallback](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#queued-move-retains-its-fallback-point-through-target-loss-payoff220).

Payoff219 unifies fresh and retained visible-waypoint selection under the
retail counted self-record scope. A32-case failing-first production regression
and fresh original96-case replay retain the existing frozen expectations.
MAP-04.2 remains open for the wider scope audit. See
[fresh selection](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#fresh-waypoint-selection-shares-the-counted-scope-payoff219).

Payoff218 integrates unseen Move-to-point normalization, issue-time Shift
capture and visible hostile Follow. New original repeats/control prove the
native fallback. The older Smart refusal expectations remain valid; only the
synthetic test's incorrectly named Move producer is corrected to Smart.
Three failing-first production regressions cover replacement/removal/cold save.
Wider TARGET-03.1/03.2 remain open; see
[Move admission](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#move-normalizes-unseen-targets-before-admission-payoff218).

Payoff217 integrates UnitShareVision's captured reveal mask, alliance-order
semantics, idempotent refresh, full public visibility getters and Save154.
Two eight-scene original repeats match an unhooked control; actual Smart/fog/
revocation/cold-save regressions pass without rewriting existing fixtures.
Wider TARGET-03.1/03.2 stay open; see
[unit reveal](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#unit-sharing-captures-a-reveal-mask-payoff217).

Payoff216 integrates retained Smart approach point reissue and distant Move's
initial persistent phase, with two new original repeats, an unhooked control,
Save153 and failing-first production regressions. Prior persistent cancellation
and fade timing fixtures are preserved. Wider TARGET-03.1/03.2 remain open; see
[target-loss phases](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-loss-distinguishes-approach-from-persistent-follow-payoff216).

Payoff215 implements the independent Show Map visibility policy, deferred native
submission and Save152 continuation without bypassing invisibility detection.
Two original repeats and an unhooked control also expose a retained-approach
reissue branch for the next engine chunk. TARGET-03.1/03.2 remain open; see
[global visibility policy](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#show-map-retains-a-separate-visibility-policy-payoff215).

Payoff214 closes BASE-01.1: native UI point coordinates and flags now have a
complete serialization/decoded-dispatch/unit-admission trace. Public engine
commands preserve the same fractional coordinates through unchanged retail
motion and saved continuations. See [player point transport](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#player-ui-point-transport-and-admission-payoff214).

Payoff213 closes E2E-04.2: active orders survive real-map reload, removal
callbacks and pool pressure with exact cold continuations. Adaptive scratch and
spatial owner lifetimes are separated. See [lifetime acceptance](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#active-orders-across-reload-callbacks-and-pool-pressure-payoff213).


Payoff212 closes E2E-04.1: active gate motion crosses verified counter/stamp
boundaries with exact saved suffixes; repeated storage, member/release and gate-ID
reuse preserve the original contracts. See [wrap and reuse acceptance](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#active-movement-across-wrap-and-reuse-boundaries-payoff212).

Payoff210 closes E2E-01.3: contention, cancellation, completion/release and queued
successors run together against unchanged retail contracts and saved engine
continuations. See [combined order variants](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#contention-cancellation-and-successors-share-the-end-to-end-baseline-payoff210).

Payoff209 closes ORDER-06.4: suspended immediate/target orders no longer execute
behind removal, and ground spell arrival delivers synchronous CHANNEL before
resource commit. Completion/release replacements preserve the next owner
frontier and unique destruction. See [interruption ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#interruption-keeps-successor-ownership-through-completion-and-release-payoff209).

Payoff208 closes ORDER-06.3: Stop/Hold cancel physical ownership independently
of idle animation, preserving visual settling and survivor queues. Two repeated
retail scenes, original word fixtures and actual engine saved continuations
pass. See [physical cancellation](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stop-cancels-physical-ownership-independently-of-animation-payoff208).

Payoff207 integrates public timed-facing angular cohorts and their independent
visual heading, with174 repeated physical decisions,381 visual visits, unhooked
public output and actual engine Save150 continuations. FORM-01.3 remains open
for its wider producers. Existing numerical fixtures stay unchanged. See
[timed-facing ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#timed-facing-cohorts-retain-physical-and-visual-headings-payoff207).

Payoff206 closes E2E-01.2: dynamic insertion/removal, terrain edits and yielding
join ground Smart and fogged pursuit in the combined baseline. Three unchanged
Frida contracts and eight actual engine fresh/save journeys repeat twice per
edition, retaining full intermediate state and completion limits. See
[dynamic and pursuit variants](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#dynamic-blocker-and-pursuit-variants-payoff206).

Payoff205 closes E2E-01.4: the combined baseline pins the completed formation,
crowd and gate contracts. Six original checks and all eight actual game
fresh/save journeys run together, twice in each edition, retaining every child
scope and unfinished-order exclusion. See
[combined variants](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#formation-crowd-and-gate-variants-payoff205).

Payoff204 advances SEP-01.2: removal now retires separation before target
callbacks; owner/type/pause refreshes cannot recreate it while removal is
pending. Complete retail repeats/control and failing-first engine/save checks
agree at that boundary. Counted work and internal retirement intervals remain
open. See [removal boundary](retail-pathfinding-removal.md).

Payoff203 closes E2E-01.1: the frozen cross-feature baseline now joins exact
static-detour, blocked-point and disconnected-crossing engine journeys. All37
constructed routes/230 point pairs and actual retry returns are asserted twice
per edition, with existing saved motion and final-ownership checks. See
[cross-feature baselines](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md).

Payoff202 advances MAP-04.2: next-step collection and moving-peer resolution
now share one captured spatial-counter scope. Forty-eight complete original
calls and failing-first production regressions match; the wider exit audit
remains open. See [combined blocker scope](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#collection-and-yielding-share-one-captured-scope-payoff202).

Payoff201 advances SEP-01.2: Mechanical Critter now owns its latent category
through the real item/buff lifecycle. Repeated retail/control scenes and engine
RNG/pose/owner/removal/save regressions agree; counted suppression stays open.
See [Mechanical Critter](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mechanical-critter-retains-a-latent-separation-category-payoff201).

Payoff200 closes GROUP-03.4.6 and GROUP-03.4.6.2 after auditing their completed
engine/retail child contracts. Complete thirteen-member mixed/homogeneous,
cancellation/reuse and saved journeys still match unchanged fixtures; broader
moving Captain policies stay open. See [thirteen-member closure](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#audited-thirteen-member-captain-contract-payoff200).

Payoff199 advances GROUP-03.2: explicit melee/ranged/ground weapon windups
now grant the retail Attack speed-cap exemption before cooldown evaluation.
Two fresh retail repeats and an observer-free control agree; failing-first
order/replacement/save regressions pass. The remaining notification guards and
captain domains stay open. See [explicit swing producers](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#explicit-weapon-windups-release-the-shared-speed-cap-payoff199).

Payoff198 advances ORDER-02.2/02.3 and GROUP-04.6: replace the sixteen-pending
order cap with the verified retail501-head bound and geometrically growing
sparse rings. FIFO/save/wrapped-growth/reset regressions preserve ownership;
the bounded original append oracle retains exact admission and publication.
The wider queue-control tasks stay open. See [queue capacity](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#queued-orders-grow-to-the-retail-admission-bound-payoff198).

Payoff197 closes ORDER-01.3 with complete blocked recovery and genuine Shift
successor dispatch. Repeated retail task/FIFO cleanup and an unhooked control
agree; Move exit clears stale retry/wait state, with failing-first saved
continuation regressions. See [blocked recovery](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-recovery-unwinds-before-queued-successor-payoff197).

Payoff196 closes TARGET-04.2 with repeated47-stage multi-member retry/range
lifetimes and an actual blocked-spell receiver fix. Repeated public Holy Light
and an observer-free control agree; production regressions preserve failure,
queued continuation and cancellation. See [long retries and failure](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#long-member-retries-preserve-range-and-failure-outcomes-payoff196).

Payoff195 implements the missing blocked multi-member completion retry and
moves counter reset after synchronous notifications. The original1536-case
export, failing-first engine boundaries and cold-save continuation pass. The
TARGET-04.2 lifetime remained open at Payoff195 and is covered below by
Payoff196; no new TODO was added.
See [blocked completion retries](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-group-completion-retries-before-the-twentieth-scan-payoff195).

Payoff194 closes SCHED-02.4: actual public retail Channel callback mutation
preserves the current owner frontier and next-visit retirement. The engine now
dispatches simultaneous ready callbacks in stored order, retains invalid rows
and emptied owners through save/load, then prunes backward at preparation. See
[completion callback boundaries](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#completion-callbacks-preserve-traversal-and-retirement-boundaries-payoff194).

Payoff193 closes GROUP-03.4.6.2.1.2: actual range-producer departure/return and
save composition now accompanies the previously integrated public factories.
Move retains an existing Captain-target request on a new Captain point; two
retail repeats preserve15 heads and770 public markers matching the control.
The failing-first request/research/save regression and natural-departure checks
pass Classic/TFT. See [Captain range retention](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#captain-range-producers-and-retained-point-requests-payoff193).

Payoff192 closes ORDER-04.4: cold original point factories and wrappers grow
through 513 simultaneous objects, execute 2052 final releases and reuse without
allocation. Repeated public Move bursts match the observer-free control. Engine
queues now return empty storage to the existing constant-time pool after cancel
or final dispatch; failing-first queue/reuse and save regressions pass.
See [cold factories and queue storage](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#cold-point-factories-and-empty-queue-storage-payoff192).

Payoff191 closes BASE-01.2: repeated public JASS and Captain AI requests reach
the common point bridge with distinct owners. Move now retains the retail
arrival minimum at admission, with failing-first JASS/save/AI regressions.
See [common point admission](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#jass-and-ai-common-point-admission-payoff191).

Payoff190 closes SCHED-02.3 with1,000 complete populated retail owner ticks,
identical repeated phase sequences and304 public markers matching an observer-free
control. Engine radius collection now visits the actual newest-first group list;
a retained geometric generation snapshot removes per-owner malloc/free.
Public Captain/separation construction and phase/work regressions pass.
See [populated owner phases](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#populated-owner-phases-and-retained-visit-storage-payoff190).

Payoff189 closes GROUP-03.3 with complete original shared-factory growth through
three64-object blocks, exact radius mutation/departure publication and allocation-free
reuse. The engine replaces repeated owner scans and nested binding validation with
a derived slot index, preserving logical identities, owner order and cold saves.
Public13-member Captain growth/Stop/save/reuse regressions and existing repeated
Frida journeys pass. See [shared parameter growth](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-parameter-growth-and-indexed-ownership-payoff189).

Payoff188 integrates the portal placement exclusion lifetime into the engine:
its captured spatial counter remains held through bounded admission and restores
on success or exhaustion. A failing-first 24-case engine regression, 48 complete
original-wrapper cases and repeated minimal-hook public controls verify the
contract; Ghidra and `MapPathfinding.java` retain the corrected footprint/mask
ABI and null outer-callback producer. MAP-04.2 remains open for its wider scopes;
no new leaves. See [portal exclusion](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#portal-placement-holds-its-authoritative-spatial-counter-payoff188).

Payoff187 advances TARGET-02.1 and MAP-04.2: group coarse paths now borrow a
member pose without acquiring its self exclusion. Complete ground-to-air pursuit
matches616 follower states,621 target states and466 saved follower suffix states,
including signed-zero velocity. Fresh Frida repeats/control verify1239 group
boundaries,40 group/33 member coarse requests and the sole self-region producer;
saved Ghidra layouts/ABIs and mapper preserve the distinction. Wider scopes
remain open; no new leaves or broader closure claim. See [group path ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#group-routes-borrow-poses-not-self-exclusions-payoff187).

Payoff186 closes BASE-01.3 and advances TARGET-02.1: air/ground Follow now
shares physical target ownership. Native flying pursuit exposes and fixes independent target-region
termination and in-range cached-route retention. Two Frida repeats/control,
617 raw engine owner states and467 saved continuation states agree; three lane
compositions cover native orders/save/Stop. Ghidra/mapper preserve the contracts.
The completed target-Move/Holy-Light comparison records range, retained target
identity and persistence/routing flags. No new leaves or broader closure claim.
See [flying Follow](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#flying-follow-shares-physical-target-ownership-payoff186).

Payoff185 closes TARGET-01.3: actual ground Holy Light captures its authored
range in Move's physical target owner, without per-frame spell polling. Three
fresh observed repeats match591 raw group visits; an observer-free control
matches all376 public markers. The engine public order matches50 raw fine
pose/velocity samples and the final public stop. Non-stock ROC/TFT lifecycle,
Stop/replacement/removal and Save146 regressions accompany saved Ghidra packet
ABIs and mapper evidence. Wider spell timing/perimeter/air/structure/point
producers stay in their existing tasks. See [spell approaches](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#spell-approaches-capture-a-physical-stopping-range-payoff185).

Payoff184 advances TARGET-01.3 with the Move-owned predicted collision-edge
range predicate:822 original fixtures and public Holy Light/Stop regressions;
303 failures before the fix,3,342 assertions after. All403 spell tests pass in
Classic/TFT. Saved Ghidra and mapper preserve the actual shared spell caller,
authored range producer and five ABIs. Captured approach completion/perimeter
handling and live producer timing remain open; three incomplete launches are
explicitly rejected as gameplay evidence. No new leaves or closure claims.
See [spell target range](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#spell-target-range-uses-predicted-collision-edges-payoff184).

Payoff183 advances MAP-04.2: Stop recovery holds the captured spatial counter
through fine-pose publication and restores it on clear/admitted/exhausted exits.
The public production regression fails16 assertions before the fix; all156 pass
afterward, alongside48 fresh original exit cases. Saved Ghidra/mapper evidence
preserves the captured-pointer lifetime. No new leaves or broad closure claim.
See [embedded recovery](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#embedded-recovery-holds-its-spatial-record-through-publication-payoff183).

Payoff182 advances TARGET-03.1/03.2 with Blink-owned post-relocation TargetLost,
world-hidden validation windows, nested-clear behavior and Save145 runtime
exclusion. Seven production regressions and90 fresh original cases pass; complete
prepared Frida repeats/control streams verify the public Blink producer.
The saved Ghidra/mapper now preserve its RET8 ABI and destination scalar layout.
No new leaves or closure claims. See [Blink notification](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blink-publishes-target-loss-after-relocating-payoff182).

Payoff181 closes ORDER-05.3: live unit-release deadlines/serials and JASS identities now survive cold load, outgoing primary owners drain software0.2s before replacement, and callback-created first timers retain popped clocks. Exact live wrap/load words, production persistence/release regressions, fresh432 original cases and full prepared wrap/UI-load control archives pass; saved Ghidra/mapper retain clock/wrapper fields and nine ABIs. See [pending request clocks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#pending-request-clocks-survive-wrap-and-load-payoff181).

Payoff180 closes ORDER-05.2: range listeners now poll at their registration-phased primary deadlines, with stable repeat serials, popped-clock callback creation and three-stage peer/self releases. Indexed requests and linear stamped occupant reconciliation replace movement-wide scans and native quadratic lookup; ordered fine prediction, reverse entrants, filters, dense4096 removal and cold logical saves are covered. Fresh432 original cases and complete repeated/control Frida archives pass; Ghidra/mapper retain the recovered query/ABI evidence. See [range listener requests](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#range-listeners-poll-ordered-occupants-at-request-deadlines-payoff180).

Payoff179 closes ORDER-05.1: unit removals now use an indexed deadline/unsigned-serial heap in the primary drain, with O(1) membership, O(log N) insertion/cancellation/pop and exact borrowed callback clocks. Twelve failing-first/production-path regressions, focused Classic/TFT suites, fresh 432 original-code cases and two complete repeated/control Frida archives pass. Ghidra layouts/ABIs and mapper are saved; repeating listeners and pending-clock persistence remain ORDER-05.2/03. See [unit release heap](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#unit-releases-join-the-primary-deadline-heap-payoff179).

Payoff178 closes ORDER-03.2: nested Stop retains its transient head, death
families deliver synchronously with the retail presence-query timing, and
removal retains its payload while suspending accepted point orders. Defend owns
retirement/detach notifications. Failing-first native regressions, fresh original
411-case execution and complete Frida streams pass; Ghidra and the mapper are
saved. See [nested order lifetime](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#nested-orders-retain-their-packet-and-removal-suspends-execution-payoff178).

Payoff177 closes ORDER-03.1 with synchronous indexed issued-order subscribers,
append-ranked iteration, insertion cutoffs and immediate DestroyTrigger
suppression followed by ordered primary-clock cleanup. Actual native
forward/reverse mutation, reuse/save and scaling regressions pass alongside 627
fresh original cases and complete archived Frida controls/repeat. Nested Stop,
death and removal composition stays in ORDER-03.2. See
[synchronous subscribers](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#synchronous-issued-order-subscribers-and-deferred-trigger-cleanup-payoff177).

Payoff176 closes ORDER-01.18. Short Patrol retires synchronously; leg completion
admits queued Move before its return, and queued Patrol rotates with its captured
origin. Actual acquisition/damage/loss resume the same leg. Sparse FIFO storage
reserves its continuation and saves both endpoints; unqueued reversal allocates
nothing. Complete4-capture/one-control reconstruction and failing-first native/
frame/queue/save regressions pass. See [Patrol leg completion](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#patrol-leg-completion-admits-queued-successors-payoff176).

Payoff175 closes ORDER-01.10's public Attack ownership contract. Attack Once
approaches, commits once and retires at the saved swing deadline; ordinary Attack
Ground approaches and retains its point head/FIFO without damage. All5,184 complete
original weapon-slot results match the engine, including second-slot artillery.
Failing-first native/frame/queue/save/death/reuse regressions pass. Full approach,
visibility and combat scalar composition retain their existing TARGET/NUM scopes.
See [Attack Once and Ground ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#attack-once-and-ordinary-attack-ground-ownership-payoff175).

Payoff174 integrates the independent Attack swing-completion request and target-loss
retirement: immediate target detachment, deferred public head/FIFO handoff,
replacement/death guards and saved primary deadlines. Original288 timing-producer
witnesses and failing-first native/frame/save regressions pass; ORDER-01.10 stays
open for Attack Once and non-artillery Attack Ground. See
[swing completion](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#lost-attack-targets-wait-for-swing-completion-payoff174).

Payoff173 integrates ORDER-01.10 public Attack/Attack Move/artillery Attack Ground
heads and invalid-target point snapshots, including physical frames, FIFO handoff,
save/load, automatic combat, death and reuse. The leaf stays open for swing timing,
Attack Once and non-artillery Attack Ground. See [Attack admission](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#attack-user-head-admission-and-point-snapshots).

Payoff172 closes NUM-04.6's game-purpose RNG ownership/seed-side-effect contract:
all45 states now seed and save independently; public item selection uses purpose35.
Original56-call vectors and all530 archived purpose draws verify; actual engine
startup/native/query/save regressions pass. See [purpose RNG ownership](retail-pathfinding-purpose-random.md).

Payoff171 closes NUM-04.5: production map loading now initializes the boot owner,
selects the fixed or stored host setup seed, replaces race preferences and
resolves12 logical players before main. Five locked/unlocked profiles match
native query/RNG words through first movement and save/load;1611 archived owner
draws and530 separate-stream draws verify without mismatches. See
[startup seeding](retail-pathfinding-startup-seed.md). NUM-04.6 remains open.

Payoff170 closes FORM-05.1: public independent Move now uses physical singleton
owners, and positive-request eligibility is published only by multi-member
classification. Both selected phases and independent controls match2399 owner
visits/5369 member commits; cold saves preserve1919 visits/4289 commits.
See [selection and independent ownership](retail-pathfinding-formation-selection.md).

Payoff169 closes FORM-05.2 with the complete public selected passage and cold-save
continuation:340 owner visits,1,825 member commits and exact regroup/layout timing.
Move now publishes the initial ordered-mean heading and fresh formation flag at
creation. Independent-control full journeys remain FORM-05.1.
See [selected passage](retail-pathfinding-formation-passage.md).


Payoff168 advances TARGET-03.1/03.2 with ability-owned scalar Apiv publication
and synchronous TargetLost. Seven production regressions integrate27 original
listener chains, delayed own/neutral/shared-vision policy, cold save, epoch
rollover, cancellation and4,096 equal-deadline fades. Complete delivered Frida
repeats verify the public publisher separately. Broader contributor/visibility
policies remain open; no additional leaves or closure claims.
See [fade publication](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#delayed-invisibility-publication-payoff168).


Payoff167 implements synchronous ShowUnit/Cargo TargetLost, target-specific ordered
Follow subscriptions, task-handoff renewal and Save136 registration identity.
Two repeated retail producer chains and failing-first production regressions cover
loss, successor activation, cold load and4096 unrelated actors. TARGET-03.1/03.2
remain open for wider policies; no new TODOs. See [synchronous target loss](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md#synchronous-world-presence-loss-payoff167).


Payoff166 implements Move/Smart fogged-target admission, hidden cached-point
arrival, approach-to-Follow local-path invalidation and Save135 fog modifier
ownership. The actual public engine scene matches238 raw retail owner states
and28 saved continuation states; TARGET-03.1/03.2 remain open for wider policy
producers and TargetLost compositions. See [target visibility](retail-pathfinding-target-visibility.md).


Payoff165 closes FORM-04.2: retained warp-marker classification and admitted
route-replacement counter resets are implemented alongside Payoff164's denied
route owner. Actual public group/cold-save regressions and three complete
retail warp observations pass. See [formation warp markers](retail-pathfinding-formation-warp.md).


Payoff160 integrates the ordinary Captain retained-point speed multiplier,
implicit Move/Adro minimum eligibility, and range-entry speed restoration.
Five twice-observed public scenes match their controls; failing-first actual
engine request/removal/home/save regressions pass. GROUP-03.4.7.3 remains open
for combat, special counts and full new trajectories; no new TODOs. See
[retained point speed](retail-pathfinding-captain-policy.md#retained-point-speed-policy-payoff160).

Payoff159 replaces the guessed group-flee timer with recovered home/removal
policy, separates the retreat flag from state, registers CaptainAttack and
preserves periodic deadlines and retained requests through Save133. New
failing-first regressions and repeated/control speed/update evidence are
[recorded here](retail-pathfinding-captain-policy.md). GROUP-03.4.7.3 remains open
for complete new trajectories, combat and wider roster policies; no new TODOs.

Payoff148 integrates counted endpoint/waypoint/blocker self scopes and null-self terrain collection, with 96 complete original consumer cases and request-exit regressions. MAP-04.2 remains open for resolver/recovery/portal/group composition; no new tasks. See [consumer scopes](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#fine-consumers-hold-captured-self-through-their-queries-payoff148).

Payoff146 closes MAP-04.1: captured fine-record counters preserve aliases,
outer exclusions and null-self target queries. All45 original fine/coarse
scenarios match complete stage windows, counters/classes and final routes;
see [scope matrix](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#complete-fine-and-coarse-scope-matrix-payoff146).

Payoff145 implements ground support refresh state, FLOAT deck eligibility, prior-deep AMPH selection and non-forcing idle physics with saved continuations. MAP-02.2 stays open for exact support geometry/sampling; no new TODOs are introduced. See [support refresh](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ground-support-refresh-state-payoff145).
Payoff144 closes SEP-04.2/03 with complete mixed-crowd and enabled/disabled ground engine traces, including saved continuations. Ordinary point requests now use newest-first physical owners, retries share the adjusted coarse endpoint, and arrival turning avoids new retry work. See [crowd composition](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-crowds-individual-physical-owners-and-adjusted-retries-payoff144).
Payoff143 closes ROUTE-01.2:112 complete invalid-start member decisions match original buffers/work/retries and exact RNG. Load now discards unsaved query history while retaining unit curves; seven failing assertions are fixed and repeated UI-load captures verify fresh search owners. See [invalid consumers and load](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#invalid-start-consumers-and-fresh-search-owners-after-load-payoff143).

Payoff142 separates coarse admission from retained fine consumption, preserves the disabled-adaptive one-point cache and removes redundant fine refills.208 initialized ordinary consumer scenarios plus48 saved next advances pass; Payoff143 completes the remaining invalid-start consumer/history integration. See [independent caches](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#independent-coarse-admission-and-fine-cache-payoff142).
Payoff140 closes ROUTE-01.1 with all-class oblique fine/coarse producer words and200 actual engine adapter rows. Move now advances owned arrays directly, eliminating full-chain scratch copies; saved layout and numerical results stay exact. See [reconstruction and owned consumption](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#oblique-reconstruction-and-direct-owned-consumption-payoff140).

Payoff139 ports MAP-02.2's terrain/bridge independence and removes inferred-deck scans plus a duplicate terrain buffer. All256 byte lanes and three captured map grids survive creation/save/death. Numerical support geometry remains open; see [bridge terrain authority](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#bridges-preserve-authored-terrain-payoff139).

Payoff138 closes FOOT-03.2: actual widget footprints now publish separate pooled
C2/10/08/04 region identities alongside ordinary movers. Retirement and inverse
rasterization retain different link/refcount histories. All16 mixed scenarios
and112 states match original consumers, stamps and storage in-O0/-O2; Save122
preserves sparse memberships and inverse-raster inputs in owner save order. See
[widget regions](retail-pathfinding-categories.md#payoff138-widget-regions-and-mixed-lifetimes).


Payoff137 closes FOOT-03.1 with shared production raw-cell eligibility, native
hierarchy49-link and lane/cell ordering, and test-first endpoint/collector
regressions. Original/model/C results and every stamp match50112 cases per build.
Actual widget region producers/refcounts remain FOOT-03.2. See
[consumer integration](retail-pathfinding-categories.md#payoff137-exact-raw-cell-consumer-eligibility).


Payoff136 closes SEP-03.1/03.2/03.3 and MAP-05.3. Both engine spatial maps now
use stable pooled raw records; fine search publishes metadata and observes cells
in native clockwise order. Independent maintenance and Save121 preserve stamps.
Static region producers/consumer caps remain FOOT-03.1/03.2. See
[fine-map integration](retail-pathfinding-storage.md#payoff136-fine-map-integration).

Payoff135 closes MAP-05.1 with exact raw-record growth/reclamation/reuse in the
engine proximity map, pooled identities, scalar maintenance and Save120 stamps.
See [spatial storage](retail-pathfinding-storage.md). Fine record producers and
consumers retain SEP-03.1/03.2/03.3 and FOOT-03.1/03.2.


Payoff134 closes BASE-02.2: the producer/category/consumer inventory now drives
item admission and occupancy, building own-mover records and immediate
pickup/drop publication. See [object-category integration](retail-pathfinding-categories.md).
FOOT-03.1/03.2 retain full raw-link history and ordering work.

Payoff133 closes SEP-02.3 and SEP-04.1: complete shared-RNG overlap owner
passes match every contribution, endpoint and occupied rectangle; cached
intrusive link slots make owner retirement constant-time. See
[complete overlap integration](retail-pathfinding-overlap.md).

Payoff132 closes SEP-02.2: an independent ordered proximity index replaces
server-area enumeration; every update and individual neighbor contribution in
nine retail clusters matches exactly. Save119 rebuilds both logical rectangles
in saved order. See [ordered proximity composition](retail-pathfinding-proximity.md).


Payoff131 closes BASE-02.1: the complete authored movement-profile table now
feeds Move query/category and independent hierarchy selection. Positive-speed
zero-query units move; unbuild publishes category08. Full original, compiled C
and repeated/control live evidence is retained. See
[authored movement profiles](retail-pathfinding-profiles.md).

Payoff130 corrects coarse exclusion to use published fine rectangles, including
category-zero flying targets, and consolidates ordered search/restoration. Full
original scope/edit evidence and production boundary/exit regressions are
retained. MAP-04.1/02 remain open for their broader owner integration. See
[published exclusion geometry](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md).

Payoff129 closes MAP-06.1: map replacement retires old routes, queues, spatial
owners and worker frontiers before freeing world data or unit rows. Actual MPQ
reloads compare exact public movement across eight restarts and a changed-size
level; the complete retail restart/ChangeLevel report and observer controls
reconstruct unchanged. See [ordered map release](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#map-replacement-retires-movement-owners-before-world-data).

Payoff128 closes MAP-06.2: load rebuilds active fine membership in save order,
with exact retail UI-load suffix evidence and actual engine ordering/active-route
regressions. Save118 removes per-cell ranks from the payload. See
[spatial load order](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#spatial-load-rebuilds-membership-in-save-order).

Payoff127 closes SEP-01.3: the repeated live policy matrix now drives engine
eligibility and channel/type lifecycle regressions. Integer selector parsing
preserves low bits without a float conversion. See [separation policy integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#separation-policy-refresh-follows-channel-and-type-lifecycle).

Payoff126 closes ACC-01.1/01.2/02.2/04.1:3,288 complete branch witnesses,
marker-domain proofs and ordinary cost/budget evidence now have production C
regressions. The side walker prunes proven-clear interior reads;26 explicit
Ghidra ABIs are saved. See [adaptive witness integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-branch-witnesses-justify-clear-interior-pruning).

Payoff125 closes ROUTE-02.2: complete original-code blocker/selector evidence
now drives four production regressions, including target occupancy, the ordered
32-token cap and persistent peer waits. Ghidra is saved; no live crowd-cap claim
is made. See [target blockers after construction](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-blockers-return-after-fine-route-construction).

Payoff124 advances ORDER-01.18 without closing it: complete retail combat repeats
match1,707 public records and33 ordered endpoint continuations each. Patrol now
keeps the verified851991 active head separately from the issued851990 command.
Ghidra saves both endpoint/task layouts and the full register/stack factory ABIs.
The remaining engine route/task composition stays in the existing item; see
[Patrol continuation ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#patrol-uses-a-two-endpoint-public-continuation).

Payoff123 closes ORDER-01.17: two complete retail repeats match1,455 public
records each through Follow parent loss, temporary combat, nested replacement
and target/subject reuse. Engine regressions preserve queued ownership and
Save117 before deferred cleanup; empty-group target retirement stays constant-time.
Ghidra annotations, typed identities and portable mappings are saved. See
[Follow target loss](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#follow-target-loss-preserves-temporary-combat-ownership).

Payoff121 implements the verified siege-roster and disabled-weapon approach
range producers within GROUP-03.4.6.2.1.2, including retained physical ranges
and Save115. Two retail repeats agree on seven admissions and twenty roster
queries. The parent stays open for its remaining public producers. See
[siege captain ranges](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#captain-approach-ranges-retain-the-siege-roster-snapshot).

Payoff120 closes GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.2.2.2: deferred RemoveUnit withdraws the
logical roster, Stop/retarget retain it, and fresh refill uses new shared owners.
Three complete repeated scenes match14,981 engine commits and615 shared
footprints, with15 saved continuations. Move also ports the whole-roster range
gate and resets inherited coarse admission clocks. Ghidra evidence is saved.
See [cancellation and refill](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#final-captain-binding-cancellation-withdrawal-and-refill).

Payoff119 closes ORDER-01.14: accepted public Defend/Rally cancel active Move;
repeated, disabled, unresearched and invalid commands reject before admission.
Three repeated retail scenes match210 public records and99 engine movement
commits, including15 saved continuations. Concrete owners handle explicit
directions, inverse cleanup and queue cancellation. Ghidra evidence is saved.
See [modal admission](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#modal-orders-validate-before-replacing-active-movement).

Payoff118 closes NUM-02.9/02.10: original callback/rearm order, shared owner
deadline ties and deferred public timer retirement now drive exact engine Move.
Two complete native scenes, bounded release controls and five saved continuations
pass. Ghidra mappings, layouts and evidence are saved. See
[callback mutation](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#timer-callback-mutations-preserve-heap-order-and-deferred-release).

Payoff117 closes NUM-02.9.2/02.11: exact public scalar elapsed/remaining,120-second
counted requests, paused remainder and300-second timer-clock wrap now drive actual
engine Move with five saved continuations. General periodic shared-deadline
mutation/catch-up remains NUM-02.10. See [counted timer clocks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#counted-timer-requests-use-their-own-scalar-clock).

Payoff116 fixes the public authored-timeout scalar getter and its resulting
Move speed/trajectory. Two complete retail controls,70 engine motion commits
and165 saved suffix commits pass in Classic/TFT. Timer elapsed/remaining,
large/epoch scheduling and general heap mutation remain open; no checkbox
is closed from capture alone. Ghidra layouts/ABI and MapPathfinding.java
are saved. See [authored timeout](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-timer-timeout-survives-scheduling-and-pause).

Payoff112 closes FORM-04.1: two complete fixed-tick size/removal/point-retarget
producers preserve cached survivor layouts and repeat all34 fresh layout words.
Move now replaces stale arrival state and retires pending held-arrival work;
actual public mutation/save and648 native regroup boundary regressions pass.
Ghidra helper ABI, names and xrefs are saved. See
[mutation and regroup](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fixed-tick-formation-mutation-and-regroup-preserve-cached-state).

Payoff111 closes FORM-02.3: public moving-group boundaries retain the first
12 entries, and admission now owns its destination through moving-unit stops.
Two complete native repeats and actual engine JASS/layout regressions pass;
see [moving formation boundary](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-moving-formations-retain-a-twelve-member-request-boundary).

Payoff110 closes FORM-03.2: blocked-slot adjustment now follows classification,
and fine queries use current predicted sources. Repeated fresh/cached native
ticks match360 engine stage words, including a saved continuation. See
[blocked formation slots](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-formation-slots-adjust-after-classification).

Payoff109 closes FORM-03.1: four actual ordinary/Alt input captures reproduce
one complete mixed-rank formation owner tick, and all456 scalar stages match
in the engine. Move now runs the recovered ordinary projected classifier and
held-member stop path; physical UI policy survives admission/save. Ghidra and
MapPathfinding.java are saved. FORM-01.3 remains open for the wider producers.
See [actual UI formation policy](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ordinary-and-alt-formation-ticks-retain-the-actual-ui-policy).

Payoff108 closes FORM-01.2: repeated public mixed-rank creation and Chaos
prove installed mover ranks and ordered layout buckets. Move now owns/saves
the installed rank and uses the recovered DLL-parsed spacing scalar. Ghidra
and its replayable mappings are saved. See
[mixed authored ranks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-authored-ranks-install-before-formation-layout).

Payoff106 closes SCHED-03.2: queued public Stop/owner/removal repeats expose and
fix missing coarse-request cancellation at engine task transitions. Saved FIFO
survivors and next admission are covered in both schemas; Ghidra is saved. See
[local request cancellation](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#task-transitions-retire-every-local-scheduler-request).

Payoff105 closes SCHED-03.3 with2560 original-instruction charge/wrap and
clean-counter admission cases, matching engine operations in all64 buckets.
Fine save validation now rejects unreachable work totals beyond admission plus
one bounded search. Synthetic work wrap is distinguished from public movement
and owner-clock rollover. See
[work boundaries](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#work-counter-wrap-preserves-unsigned-admission).

Payoff104 closes SCHED-03.1's class/priority producer inventory: RTTI-backed
non-unit identities, repeated public class15 searches, engine projectile/fine
ownership and saved FIFO regression are synchronized with saved Ghidra mappings.
Full missile ability trajectories are not certified by this scheduling leaf.
See [non-unit scheduling](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#non-unit-path-producers-share-scheduler-class15).

Payoff103 fixes target-group priority admission and distinguishes point-order
waypoints from resolved targets. See
[target priority](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-priority-keeps-the-groups-search-quota).

Payoff102 integrates missing coarse admission alongside fine queues and closes
SCHED-04.1/02 with complete repeated retail contention evidence and actual engine
movement/save regressions. See [coarse and fine contention](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#coarse-and-fine-contention-retain-independent-player-fifos).

Payoff101 closes NUM-04.1/02: the
shared overlap/retry draw order now reaches public movement, including paused
membership and saved continuation. Native and engine agree on1361 motion commits,
830 separation visits,91 retries and12667 saved continuation commits. Classic and
TFT each passed2544 tests/6,386,799 assertions at that checkpoint;598 pathfinding-tool Python checks and
eighteen fresh strict contracts pass. Saved Ghidra retains694 roles,73 layouts/
506 fields,364 ABIs and61 globals. The performance rewrite preserves these checks. A visible twelve-member
Rise of the Naga capture has measured one-second windows above55 FPS. Earlier
CPU records omitted the first post-order simulation tick. The allowance is
**0.8 ms per display frame (5% of16 ms)**, including orders and search; simulation
tick averages cannot establish acceptance. The previous amortized-budget claim
is withdrawn. The source195 full Classic/TFT checkpoint passes2578 tests and
6,841,695 assertions; eighteen fresh strict contracts retain their two known
adaptive differences. Corrected captures include that tick: twelve
selected campaign units average0.409 ms of movement per100-ms tick, and all12
acquire new Move requests on four commands. Campaign movement peaks at1.556 ms
before initial command work is added, so campaign and mass-movement acceptance
both remain open.
Individual spikes and mass-movement scaling remain unresolved; see the
[production-map measurements](performance.md#october-4-production-map-follow-up).
See [random consumers](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-retry-and-overlap-draws-preserve-complete-movement)
and [scaling priorities](performance.md#october-4-literature-shortlist-exact-retail-simulation-at-scale).

Current priority: close all 113 remaining pathfinding leaves. Complete coherent
chunks with Ghidra and Frida evidence, integrate each verified behavior into the
engine, add production-path regressions, update the evidence and counts, and
commit each completed chunk. Avoid further task splits except when necessary.

Performance constraints remain open:
Query-time whole-world synchronization has been removed. Dirty publication,
sparse owner/provider membership, stamped search storage and bounded physical
cohort lookup are integrated without closing unverified retail contracts.
IceCrown retains5,957 static scenery entities; the1,024-unit corridor workload
still exceeds the5% movement budget (8.72 ms/tick) and averages only144 advancing units.
Validate hundreds to low thousands of actual movers before further backlog
expansion. HPA* is a candidate for cached hierarchical data, but replacing the
retail corridor/pruning policy requires exact route, budget and motion evidence.
Counts describe this backlog, not a percentage of retail fidelity or an
estimate of remaining effort.
The rewrite splits the old 81 acceptance items into independently closable
leaves. Parent IDs remain for traceability; only numbered leaves are checkboxes.
Completed evidence now sits next to its specific remaining extension.
FORM-02.4 explicitly owns the immediate engine layout integration; FORM-01/03
retain the original group heading, clock prediction and refresh-to-motion chain.

BASE-02.7 explicitly adds the missing ordinary path-activation/adaptive-admission policy; the wider scheduler and group-budget contracts remain open. ROUTE-05.3 explicitly adds the parallel engine ordered-wait port; it does not close05.1/05.2 producer/cycle requirements.

Update these counts when checking, adding or splitting a task. Report progress
as **IDs closed + artifact + next runnable ID**, not additional raw test counts.
The denominator changes only when a new task is explicitly added or split.
MAP-03.7 explicitly adds the inside-footprint engine failure discovered while auditing03.4;
03.4 now closes the original getter/bridge mask and thirteen-tick journey; public construction/cache notification remain separately owned.
FOOT-01.4/05 explicitly split engine class-footprint integration into completed
nearby/direct/endpoint consumers and the now completed long/shared field geometry.
The shared field algorithm is still not retail hierarchy parity.
Moving point-Move radius publication is completed FOOT-01.2; local group
maximum/cache mutation is completed01.3.1. Bound shared7c publication through
Captain AI request batching and full passage matrices remain FOOT-01.3/02.
FINE-01.4 explicitly owns incremental engine integration of the completed static
search policy; it does not replace FINE-01.2/03 dynamic composition or FINE-02
termination requirements. FINE-01.6 explicitly splits the overlapping target link producer from01.3's completed supplied-chain matrix and separate-target engine port. FINE-01.5 explicitly adds the independently reviewable engine idle-object port; ground/flight original composition is completed within01.2, while its other public lanes remain required.
NUM-01.4 explicitly splits01.2's paired-trig production consumer from its
remaining arithmetic/conversion and public-domain inventory; both are required.
NUM-01.5/06 explicitly split the decimal/public-native engine integration from01.2.
NUM-01.8 explicitly splits the remaining public angle adapter integration from01.2;
its pointer-alias producers and other conversions remain required.
NUM-01.9 explicitly splits Pow/log/exp/public-native integration from the other
remaining numeric inventory; both leaves are required. NUM-01.10..14 now explicitly
split01.2 into independent rounding, startup, alias-producer, CRT grammar and VM
lifetime experiments;01.2 retains their inventory and newly discovered helper ownership.
NUM-01.7 explicitly adds the distinct compiled-long-literal producer mismatch
discovered during those captures; it remains required for numerical fidelity.
NUM-01.15/16 explicitly split newly discovered source-lexer grammar and decimal/hex
integer-token wrapping from the bounded compiled-real producer. All are required;
a scalar helper matrix does not establish invalid-token or integer lexer behavior.
NUM-02.4 was added explicitly to own the previously unassigned committed-facing
exclusion of NUM-02.2; it is closed independently of whole-trajectory NUM-02.3.
GROUP-04.1's callback removal/reuse and refreshed survivor requirement is split
into GROUP-04.1/03/04: callback pruning, generation-safe reuse, and the refreshed
survivor journey. GROUP-04.4 is now explicitly split further into completed-member
survivor travel (04.4), actual refresh/new destinations and reuse composition (04.5),
and full engine group storage/phase integration (04.6). All leaves are required
to satisfy the original combined acceptance item. GROUP-04.7 explicitly adds the
owned-path factory/accounting prerequisite discovered during04.5; it does not
replace the remaining survivor refresh/reuse acceptance. GROUP-04.8 explicitly
splits04.5's complete released/reused-member survivor journey from its actual
refresh/new-destination producer requirement; both leaves remain required.
ORDER-01.5 explicitly splits01.4's immutable issued-event callback ownership
from the active current-order query; both remain required for the original item.
ORDER-01.6 explicitly owns non-point command domains discovered during01.4.
These remain required for faithful public query coverage and BASE-03.1 must
index their original producers. ORDER-01.6 is explicitly split into its bounded
owner inventory and01.7..16 domain leaves. Build is separate from Harvest, and
01.15 owns the discovered synchronous target-removal timing gap; none of those
requirements is hidden behind the completed inventory or Follow query slice.
ORDER-01.15 is explicitly split into healthy active Follow loss/queued handoff
(01.15) and combat-parent/direct-free/reentrant-generation/save lifetime composition
(01.17). Both are required; the bounded synchronous public query does not close
the wider lifetime producer graph. ORDER-01.9 is explicitly split into public
Patrol admission/current ownership, endpoint reversal and queued/save lifecycle
(01.9), and automatic combat/resume plus full original endpoint/arrival policy
(01.18). The existing no-enemy reversal witness does not prove the latter.

FOOT-04.6 explicitly splits the ordinary ground public CreateUnit admission and initial native pose from04.1. Other actor/factory, terrain-level and outside-map start policies remain required.

## Work next

Prioritize a verified behavior change in the engine for each work slice. FINE-01.4 now puts the verified fine-search queue, heuristic and neighbor order
into Move-owned nearby detours, including retention when a generic field is ready.
FOOT-01.4 now applies the verified class footprint to nearby routing, destination
correction and actual Move stepping. FOOT-01.5 now uses that geometry for
long/shared expansion, flow sampling, class-aware cache reuse and unreachable
fallbacks. ROUTE-02.1 now ports all-class segment sampling, software normalization
and original next-point/progressively-farther waypoint selection. FINE-01.5 now routes location orders around idle ground units and rechecks retained segments, with exact192 original mixed-chain/C searches and fresh hfoo/hgry profile/velocity evidence. FINE-02.2 now retains nearest partial routes and resumes actual Move after idle blocker removal. BASE-02.4 now ports the captured water/amphibious masks, WPM derivation and ground object categories. ROUTE-01.3 now preserves exact fine-route source/goal coordinates. TARGET-01.4 now ports actual point Move minimum-range/heading arrival and the final previous-velocity stop. MOVE-01.4 now ports ordinary public speed setters/getters, authored integer limits and saved explicit zero. MOVE-01.5 now immediately clamps existing velocity on public speed drops and preserves saved-step words. Continue temporary-effect restoration, target/ability producers and simulation-clock phases; retain FOOT-04 admission scopes.
Keep dynamic eligibility and full-trajectory gates explicit.
Numeric inventory/alias leaves remain open, but do not expand them ahead of a
concrete routing, stepping, collision or arrival payoff. MOVE-02.3 now connects
authored speed modifiers to actual individual/group movement; NUM-01.20 retains
the completed vector-heading alias evidence. NUM-01.13 closes the default CRT byte grammar, exact native CRT identity and public high-byte Move inputs. NUM-01.16 closes decimal/octal/hex integer wrapping, native inputs and Move/save-load integration. NUM-01.7 closes the compiled decimal producer, raw native words and engine Move/save/load integration; full source grammar remains01.15. NUM-01.10/11 close rounding and shared scalar startup. NUM-01.9 closes terminating Pow/log/exp arithmetic and its public adapter; original nonreturning VM lifetime remains01.14. MAP-03.7 closes retained solid-footprint failure and engine cleanup; exact retry timing stays NUM-02.3. MAP-03.4 now retains the original Footman mask through thirteen-tick arrival and reclamation. GROUP-04.5 now composes actual survivor point
replacement through680320, original new-request refresh/layout, new-goal arrival
and both groups' final reclamation on open/wall maps. The638 velocity commits
match production exactly; the server-frame engine regression preserves the old
slot through edict reuse and reaches the replacement goal. Its inactive goal
cache is separate from active order ownership. The engine's public current-order
native now reads explicit ordinary point-Move current state, including queued
activation, Stop, arrival, save/load and reuse (ORDER-01.4). Other command
owners remain ORDER-01.10..14/16..18. ORDER-01.5 fixes immutable issued-event metadata through
delayed/reentrant and saved/suspended callbacks; it does not fix current-order
state. Follow query ownership is integrated through Move, while completed Hold
correctly retains behavior with current head0 (ORDER-01.7/08). Decimal destinations
and seven public numeric adapters now share the verified scalar contracts
(NUM-01.5/06); compiled decimal tokens now retain their separate producer (NUM-01.7). Angle adapters now retain the original inverse/polynomial and public guards
(NUM-01.8). Ghidra mapping persists528
names,42 layouts,262 fields,245 x86 prototypes and45 typed globals. The sibling CRT now retains3 partial types,8 function roles,7 globals and a verified context ABI. The strict corpus has267
declared outcomes, including repeated public order, scalar, angle and complete
public shared-pair and twelve-member witnesses. Payoff39 extends ordinary public Move-owned physical
groups with formation destination adjustment, fine FIFO/interval, committed occupancy and retry ordering. Payoff40 extends ordinary fine queues to16 unit-player rows with old-owner cancellation and Save76; wider retail
eligibility/shared parameters, producers and crowd integration remain GROUP-04.6; supplied
existing Unit/Move backing and public caller/class traversal remain BASE-01/03.1.

ROUTE-02.3 now reproduces the complete controlled wall detour in the engine,
including turn-stop stepping and saved fine-curve progress. NUM-02.7 keeps that
trajectory exact at four world origins. SCHED-02.5 now verifies the complete
primary-clock detour through actual engine RunFrame and saved continuation.
ROUTE-02.4 now corrects initial adaptive-to-fine destination selection in the
engine. ROUTE-03.3 now retains coarse buffers, consumes their own approach
threshold before fine progression and preserves saved engine motion. ROUTE-03.4
now verifies five successive refills through nonzero coarse indices and fixes
the observed-obstruction producer of the initial fine index. Clear legs steer
at their destination; blocked expansions retain the next parent point. Next
runnable work: compose a dynamic blocker during that refill (ROUTE-03.1),
then removal/retry timing (03.2); public admission phase and other clocks remain
NUM-02.3.

| Order | Task | Starts from | Finish artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | GROUP-03.4 / FOOT-01.3 | Complete stationary singleton/pair producer and native12-member batching | Extend the engine through complete shared12+1 home travel, retry/cleanup and saves |
| 2 | FOOT-01.3 | Verified shared7c reset/accumulation and Captain AI batching chain | Virtual captain/follower producer plus shared publication and saved travel |

NUM-01.2 retains numeric-family initialization inventory, reachable operand aliases,
decimal CRT grammar/locale, source lexer domains and original nonreturning VM
lifetime. Shared scalar startup and ceil/round conversions are closed01.10/11;
01.12..19 explicitly own the remaining producer experiments. Completed Pow helper/public input
evidence is linked below; do not repeat those contracts as new coverage.

## What counts as done

A leaf is one experiment, one finite case matrix, or one reviewable artifact.
Its sentence names the fixture/input and observable result required for closure.
Section-level tools and evidence links are the starting point, not extra tasks.
References to a parent ID mean its listed prerequisite leaves must be complete.
Later sections extend BASE-06.5 when they require a complete movement scenario;
isolated helper, inventory and format tasks do not wait for that baseline.

For each closure, add the exact command/fixture, expected versus observed result,
report path, evidence level (S/O/C/L), and remaining exclusions to the linked
evidence document. Mark the leaf `[x]` and update the ledger and counts in the
same change. A proved-unreachable branch may close with its producer proof.
Do not close from an unexplained mismatch, arbitrary tolerance, incomplete call
or a passing prefix of the requested lifecycle.

If a leaf uncovers several independent problems, split it into explicit new
IDs before continuing. Keep the completed part closed; do not silently enlarge
its acceptance criteria. Record blocked tasks with a concrete prerequisite ID.
Do not reopen verified work merely because a broader sibling remains open.
No task may weaken the fidelity gate by hiding a reachable behavior gap.

## Evidence and execution

Checked items carry forward the linked evidence's scope, not a new claim that
all historical experiments were rerun. The latest motion/order compositions
were verified at `b90aa33d`; reports under the [documented report root][ledger]
are `coverage-audit-b90aa33d/motion-oracle.json` (**M**) and
`coverage-audit-b90aa33d/order-tasks-oracle.json` (**O**). Binary/CRT hashes and
[reproduction commands](retail-pathfinding.md#reproduction) remain mandatory.
Other checked mechanisms cite their existing evidence sections and corpora.

Tool suffixes below mean `tools/ghidra/verify_wc3_pathing_<suffix>.py`.
Captures use `tools/frida/trace_wc3_pathfinding.py`,
`control_wc3_pathfinding.py` and `analyze_pathfinding_trace.py`. Extend an
existing fixture where possible; name a new artifact by task ID. An offline
assertion is sufficient unless that task specifically needs a live witness.

When workers are explicitly assigned, give each exact task IDs, owned files and
unique report paths. Only one worker edits a given oracle at a time. Serialize
Ghidra mutations and live retail controls. Integrate one passing result before
assigning its dependent task; worker availability does not change dependencies.

## BASE — Baseline and reproducibility

Evidence: [movement][M] and [live experiments][L]. Tools/artifacts: order_tasks, motion; Frida controller/analyzer.

### BASE-01 — Movement entry points

- [x] **BASE-01.1** Trace one player point order from UI/network admission to 680320; record actual command fields, flags and caller ABI. [Payoff214](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#player-ui-point-transport-and-admission-payoff214): two actual six-unit native UI repeats preserve ordinary/Shift/Alt point words through serialization, decoding, indirect synchronized dispatch and publication. Replacement reaches680320 mode1/dispatch1;Shift uses append. Engine public command transport now preserves binary32 coordinates; unchanged retail motion and cold continuations pass in Classic/TFT.
- [x] **BASE-01.2** Trace one JASS point order and one AI point order to their movement entry; publish whether they share the player path. [Payoff191](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#jass-and-ai-common-point-admission-payoff191): repeated public string/ById JASS enters206f00->5ffb60->05b970; real Captain AI9d44d0 enters the same bridge on Captain+44, with its own virtual actor/cohorts. Both share flag1 and completion events; five actual range publications and all307 public markers match repeat/control. Engine publishes normalized point ranges at admission for singleton/queued/prepared/AI members; failing-first JASS/save/AI regression passes64 assertions and20 original arithmetic cases in both schemas. Full player UI/network producer remains BASE-01.1.
- [x] **BASE-01.3** Payoffs184/185/186 trace public target Move and Holy Light through the shared physical target producer. The authored300/800 ranges become11.34375/26.96875 fine with radii32/31; both retain canonical target identity, while persistent target policy1801 contrasts with spell approach1000. Actual engine orders/receiver completion, exact ground/air motion, cancellation and cold saves pass; other command/formation producers keep their existing scopes. See [producer comparison](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-order-versus-ability-approach-base-013).
- [ ] **BASE-01.4** List forced-position, teleport and pathing-bypass entry points with callers; assign a separate follow-up ID to each uncovered path.
- [x] **BASE-01.5** Split public SetUnitX/Y geometry from01.4: recover predicted world query, both-axis fine reprojection and unchanged velocity/facing/order; port committed-pose writes through Move and prove the next step/save resumes. Evidence: [axis-position writes](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-axis-position-writes-retain-the-next-move-step),576 complete original writes plus576 following Move commits, repeated40 native calls/40 queries/eight writes with actual clocks,32 reproduced engine word failures followed by128 passing native/Move/save checks. Public between-frame clock prediction remains NUM-02.3; SetUnitPosition Stop/placement and other forced writers remain01.4.
- [x] **BASE-01.6** Split ordinary public SetUnitPosition/Loc Stop and scalar writes from01.4: retire Move/Patrol and queued/group state before placement; retain captured fine/world words and stationary save/load. Evidence: [forced-position Stop reaches the engine](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#forced-position-stop-reaches-the-engine), repeated28 public calls/60 queries/four Stop and placement pairs,99 motion/velocity decisions,167 actual native/frame/save assertions. Live Loc wrapper, blocked/overlapping placement, gold-mine/cargo/dead actors and other forced writers remain01.4/FOOT-04.

BASE-02.4 explicitly splits the stock movement-mask table and engine port from
BASE-02.1's remaining full authored producer/lane/support-surface inventory.

### BASE-02 — Supported input inventory

- [x] **BASE-02.1** Build a movement-type table for ground, air, water and amphibious units: authored producer, lane, masks and support surface. Payoff131: complete original parser/builder/class table and support-source inventory, immutable engine profile integration, native birth/movement and Ensnare regressions; [evidence](retail-pathfinding-profiles.md). Numerical support fixtures remain MAP-02.2. Research handoff: [BASE-02.1](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/BASE-02.1/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **BASE-02.2** Build an object-category table for units, buildings, destructibles and targets: tags, ownership and eligibility at each query consumer. Payoff134: original producer/payload inventory,50,112 original predicates and16 composed scenarios, repeated/control Frida evidence; engine item category18/query10/radius1, independent building fine records, native/placement/collector and immediate pickup/drop/save regressions. [Integration and limits](retail-pathfinding-categories.md). Raw-link history remains FOOT-03.1/03.2; live construction remains E2E-02.2/06.2. Research handoff: [BASE-02.2](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/BASE-02.2/HANDOFF.md).
- [ ] **BASE-02.3** Record valid coordinate, radius and map-size domains from public producers; attach rejection or propagation evidence for boundary inputs.
- [x] **BASE-02.4** Capture stock foot/horse/hover/fly/float/amph/disabled profiles and port their terrain/object masks. Seven public CreateUnit types publish14 paired getter/mask rows; float40/amph80 now reach engine Move validation, routes and command destinations. Original WPM256-byte outputs match C, including02+40 ->80; original widgetc2 now blocks all ground lanes and releases correctly. Evidence: [authored movement masks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-movement-masks-reach-terrain-and-object-queries). Full authored parsing and support transitions remain02.1.
- [x] **BASE-02.5** Explicitly add the missing typed UnitData map-row producer discovered by MOVE-01.4: bind original/custom movement types, turn rate and window to created units, inherit original edits, preserve stable distinct rows and free/rebind at map cleanup. Evidence: [authored speed limits reach Move](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-speed-limits-reach-move), actual disabled-owner public setter regression fails before the cache port and passes afterward; public custom amph/float/fly units use their authored terrain masks. Full retail authored producer/support-surface inventory remains02.1.

- [x] **BASE-02.6** Explicitly split public SetUnitPathing's ordinary query/category policy from02.1's larger runtime producer inventory. Trace actual native/bridge getters/setters; false preserves occupancy while zeroing own query, true restores authored masks. Two complete four-toggle live Footman captures preserve categoryca/object010000ca and cross a static wall under queryzero. All182 motion/183 velocity-position-facing commits match C and repeat. Reproduce four engine failures, then preserve disabled neighbours/target identity and bypass a retained detour for the disabled mover; public frames, wall crossing, collision restoration and240 saved continuation words pass261 assertions. Evidence: [engine payoff25](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-pathing-toggle-separates-query-from-occupancy). Placement, blocked command destinations, other profiles, repulsion/fallbacks and whole live phase parity remain02.1/FOOT-04/SEP/E2E.

- [x] **BASE-02.7** Explicitly add the ordinary path-activation policy discovered while testing budget exhaustion: recover166060's enabled adaptive flag and packed400/700 limits, distinguish group1678f0's5000 producer, and remove the engine's inherited48-cell adaptive admission gate for ordinary unit location Move. Eight full original maze requests match every coarse/fine word and both indices;16 isolated fine700/2048 requests prove budget-dependent partial endpoints. Reproduce32 full-route failures and a public maze stall; the public Move now reaches its unchanged goal, refills successive legs and repeats600 saved frames exactly. Evidence: [engine payoff29](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ordinary-path-defaults-enable-adaptive-routing). Group-owned5000 composition, charged-work cadence, admission queues and full physical retail maze motion remain GROUP/SCHED/E2E.

### BASE-03 — Coverage inventory

- [ ] **BASE-03.1** Export a reachable function/branch inventory from the entry points identified in BASE-01; link each known branch to its evidence or task ID.
- [ ] **BASE-03.2** Publish a field read/write inventory for map, path, mover, group and order state, including virtual callbacks and globals.
- [ ] **BASE-03.3** Assign every current oracle exclusion to one remaining task; list any unassigned exclusion as a new task before finishing this audit.

### BASE-04 — Shared scenario format

- [x] **BASE-04.1** Define a versioned scenario manifest with build/data hashes, map, entities, handles, clock, seed, commands and expected termination; encode the existing FIFO case. Evidence: [frozen producer baseline](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#producer-built-frozen-baseline), version1 `retail-owner-baseline-1.27.json`.
- [x] **BASE-04.2** Define normalized snapshots for cells, route indices, budgets, membership, motion and events; encode one tick from each existing motion/order report. Same evidence; frozen complete order states and `retail-motion-snapshot-1.27.json`; missing historical observations stay null.

### BASE-05 — Corpus runner

- [x] **BASE-05.1** Inventory existing oracles/captures in one manifest with command, inputs, report, expected status and evidence level; include intentional adaptive mismatches. Evidence: [corpus inventory](retail-pathfinding-corpus.md#inventory-and-acceptance), version1 `retail-pathfinding-corpus-1.27.json`; all32 oracle scripts,12 variants,61 archives and six stronger live-input replays. Historical source/map provenance limits remain explicit.
- [x] **BASE-05.2** Add a runner that executes that manifest and fails on a missing report, truncated capture, hash mismatch or unexpected exit/result. Same evidence; `run_wc3_pathfinding_corpus.py` requires fresh outputs and explicit report contracts. Asset-free rejection regressions cover changed/stale/missing inputs and reports; known reference differences cannot become passes.
- [x] **BASE-05.3** Run the manifest from a fresh output directory; record per-case status and reproducible commands without relying on stale reports. Evidence: [fresh checkpoint](retail-pathfinding-corpus.md#fresh-checkpoint), `base-05.3-fresh-provenance-corpus-20260929/corpus-results.json`: all111 declared outcomes reproduced, including two native adaptive differences, two counterfactual controls and seven rejected archives. Original-code, C and archived-live scope remain separate; no new live capture or whole-replacement claim.

### BASE-06 — One frozen ordinary-move baseline

- [x] **BASE-06.1** Initial unit admission: 34 original 680320 admissions pass predicted task-chain and queue assertions without mid-call provisioning. Evidence: [initial admission][admission], report O `complete_initial_admissions=34`; controlled point commands and seeded pools only.
- [x] **BASE-06.2** One admitted point order uses original owner updates through arrival/release; route, raw trajectory, arrival tick and reclamation equal the direct-group control. Evidence: [joined owner baseline](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#initial-admission-through-owner-updates), report `base-06.3-owner-fifo.json`, `complete_owner_admissions=1`. Seeded map/mover storage remains BASE-06.4.
- [x] **BASE-06.3** Four queued-successor cases run only owner updates through both natural arrivals and final idle; both admissions, FIFO targets and all queue/group/path/payload ownership checked. Same evidence/report, `complete_owner_fifo_cases=4`; successor first tick follows owner cadence instead of explicit same-time group calls.
- [x] **BASE-06.4** After BASE-06.3, construct that fixture's map, mover, group and order through identified original producers; enumerate any remaining seeded storage/class-cache boundary and give it a task ID. Same evidence; original no-file loader/mover construction and setters, report `base-06.4-producer-baseline.json`; allocations/caches/terrain/clock boundaries assigned explicitly.
- [x] **BASE-06.5** After BASE-06.4 and BASE-04, freeze the baseline manifest and expected intermediate states; repeat twice and assert identical normalized output and initial/final idle invariants. Same evidence; report `base-06.5-frozen-baseline.json`, two scenarios × two runs,42 snapshots and exact output digests. No full-world or RNG claim.

## MAP — Map construction and lifetime

Evidence: [search/map evidence][S]. Tools/artifacts: map_construction, load_masks, widget_masks, maps.

### MAP-01 — Map coordinates

- [x] **MAP-01.1** Terrain-origin producer and 25 no-file map loads are covered. Evidence: [map construction][map-load]; file-backed loading and non-dyadic inputs are excluded.
- [x] **MAP-01.2** Sweep negative origins and non-power-of-two dimensions through coordinate conversion; assert fine/proximity/adaptive padding and clipping. Evidence: [constructed map coverage](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#constructed-map-corners-and-padding-reach-engine-regression-coverage),25 complete actual endpoint/no-file constructors, full fine/proximity initialization and four-level padded hierarchy,400 lane corner edits and exact reversals. Engine production terrain APIs/Move adapters compare all literal cells/classes; native proximity allocation is asserted while engine uses BoxEdicts. No added IDs.
- [x] **MAP-01.3** Test each map corner at below/equal/above boundary coordinates, including non-dyadic values; record exact accepted cells and conversions. Same [evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#constructed-map-corners-and-padding-reach-engine-regression-coverage):2500 complete original constructed-map corner calls use adjacent raw words and decimal offsets on both axes;675 accept/1825 reject, with original fine/integer/cell/inverse words frozen. Full engine regression passes930530 assertions including zero-origin negative-subnormal acceptance, exact-max rejection and complete grid reversal.
- [x] **MAP-01.4** Explicitly integrate the discovered whole-map normalization mismatch: use direct software world/fine conversion for engine endpoint admission/correction, object positions, segments, fine route points and rectangle goals. Evidence: [direct coordinate conversion](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#direct-world-coordinates-preserve-boundary-cells),576 complete original edits and scalar inverse compositions, repeated O0/O2 raw comparisons, actual Move/point/rectangle/correction regression fails five assertions under the old adapter. Original public domain/padding and complete corner producers remain01.2/3.

### MAP-02 — Initial loading

- [x] **MAP-02.1** Load one file-backed WPM/map through deserialization and map creation; compare decoded masks, fine cells and hierarchy against the no-file fixture. Evidence: [complete file-backed initialization](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#file-backed-maps-retain-native-hierarchy-allocation), two full actual Storm/WPM/constructor/hierarchy returns,98304 native decoded cells and145848 classifications per run. Production MPQ reader and direct adapter match all movement masks and allocated hierarchy cells; engine corrects allocation padding, zero untouched cells and coarse ground mask6. Existing negative-origin/corner/image/failure/reload scopes remain their named tasks; no added IDs.
- [x] **MAP-02.2** Add one cliff, one water boundary and one bridge fixture; assert each supported movement lane's initial cells and support-height source. Payoff229: combined4096-cell/40-lane fixture, exact shared flyer field and authoritative LT06 mesh; [engine evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authoritative-rigid-walkable-meshes-payoff229).
- [x] **MAP-02.3** Load two overlapping authored pathing textures in both creation orders; assert object/fine/hierarchy state after loading. Evidence: [authored widget creation](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-widget-creation-preserves-snapped-pose-and-rotation), complete public LTlt/LTg1 file-backed creation in both orders,18 repeated1024-cell/four-level snapshots. Engine corrects float fixedRot and public clamp/parity snapping before linking, preserves overlap/removal and hidden generated-script binding; all literal native grids match. No new task IDs.

### MAP-03 — Invalidation producers

- [x] **MAP-03.1** Terrain edit/rebuild/reversal corpus passes 11,664 edits, 216 compositions and 30 clipped updates. Evidence: [terrain edits][map-edits]; other invalidation producers remain separate tasks.
- [x] **MAP-03.2** Widget rasterization covers 144 overlapping sequences and 96 paired reapply/remove lifecycles. Evidence: [widget lifecycle][widgets]; file loading, growth and full gameplay travel remain excluded.
- [x] **MAP-03.3** List spawn, movement, size/pathing changes, construction and removal producers with affected grids and update timing; assign uncovered work to existing IDs. Evidence: [producer/update inventory](retail-pathfinding-search.md#pathing-producer-and-update-inventory), concrete native call chains, actual engine owners and explicit timing differences for all producer families. FINE-01.6/FOOT-03 retain dynamic link/eligibility, E2E-02.2/06.2 public construction and invalidation timing, MAP-04 exclusions, MAP-05/06 storage/lifetime and GATE special records. Actual terrain/classification producer and owned engine regression close alongside ACC-02.1/03.2; no new IDs or complete-lifetime claim.
- [x] **MAP-03.4** Continue one widget-produced escape order from accepted admission to arrival/failure; retain its original produced query masks/region state and assert footprint refresh and route state throughout. Evidence: [stock Footman journey](retail-pathfinding-search.md#stock-footman-mask-through-widget-escape), original rawcode/profile getters and05c7e0 bridge publish02000002 before uninterrupted admission; unchanged proposal/footprint,13 exact velocity/position ticks, frozen per-tick route indices/count/flags, arrival, queue drain and complete reclamation. Seven-tick terrain-only control remains explicit. [Idle engine admission](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#widget-escape-idle-admission) is integrated/tested. Observed profile/cache/custom radius and direct group cadence are supplied; full public constructor/notification and authored parsing remain BASE-03.1/MAP-02/03.3; inside-footprint engine integration is03.7.
- [x] **MAP-03.5** Exercise a resource depletion/removal lifecycle; assert footprint and hierarchy changes before the next request. Evidence: [blocker lifecycle](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocker-removal-owns-static-route-invalidation), actual lumber and six-gold mine depletion repeat, preserve an overlapping tree, restore the fine patch and all four hierarchy levels before fresh point requests. Engine partial final gold extraction invalidates the cached field and warmed adaptive map; public building removal refreshes the same-callback Move and reaches its goal.
- [x] **MAP-03.6** Exercise destructible destruction and cache invalidation through the final free; assert the next route no longer sees the dead blocker. Same [lifecycle evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocker-removal-owns-static-route-invalidation): complete original collection retirement through real Storm403 free and Widget+34=NULL; gate Kill/Restore/Remove restores all observed grids before the next request. Reproduce six engine failures, then central direct/deferred free invalidates static fields/classifications while preserving independent terrain, overlap and retained nonempty death textures until actual removal.
- [x] **MAP-03.7** Explicitly add inside-footprint engine escape integration: retain static terrain/object masks, reproduce idle(0,-64) inside9×9 active construction, verify failure and interruption/Stop cleanup through normal frames. Evidence: [solid recovery](retail-pathfinding-search.md#solid-widget-cant-path-recovery), frozen original stock-mask solid9×9 variant completes after seven stationary1/32 group ticks and restores queues/group/path/task/order/wrapper pools; fresh134/134 corpus. [Engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#solid-footprint-escape-failure-and-cleanup) reproduces three stuck-lifecycle failures, then uses existing progress budget for statically blocked displacement and normal stand/queue completion. Margin escape, replacement Move, Stop, terrain and unrelated-building blocking pass. Exact engine retry/task cadence remains NUM-02.3; no static collision bypass or whole-trajectory claim.

- [x] **MAP-03.8** Port public terrain pathing queries/writes into the engine, preserve independent bits/cells, compose blocked placement, and retain the mutable terrain through save/load. Evidence: [terrain natives reach the engine](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#terrain-pathing-natives-reach-the-engine), 1,040 complete original public query/write cases (3,130 native calls), exact production scalar/flag helpers at O0/O2 twice, real JASS queries/edits and six frozen public placement endpoints, Save64 terrain/Blight round-trip. Legacy field-cache invalidation is explicit; original adaptive update timing and the broader invalidation producers remain03.3.

### MAP-04 — Temporary exclusions

- [x] **MAP-04.1** Nest self/target exclusions over overlapping objects and terrain; preserve fine reverse counter restoration and coarse same-order rebuild. Payoff146: all45 supplied original scenarios match six counter/18x18-window stages, five complete1360-byte hierarchy stages and final fine/coarse route words. Native alias/outer/null cases fail2,511 engine assertions before balanced captured-record counters and null-self query integration. Existing public pending-edit/flight coverage staysPayoff130. [Evidence and explicit producer limits](retail-pathfinding-exclusions.md#complete-fine-and-coarse-scope-matrix-payoff146).
- [ ] **MAP-04.2** Enumerate early/failure/reentrant exits from exclusion scopes; add one restoration assertion per reachable exit and one edit-during-request case.

### MAP-05 — Map/spatial capacity

- [x] **MAP-05.1** Cross one map/spatial allocation boundary, then free and reuse the storage; assert record identity, links and cell contents. Evidence: [engine raw-record storage](retail-pathfinding-storage.md), complete original/C chain and free-list equality across131072 links, frozen36-cell reuse indices,64-object stable pools, actual proximity publication and Save120. Native stale-owner release hazard is preserved as an invalid-ownership control; fine raw-record producers retain SEP-03/FOOT-03.
- [x] **MAP-05.2** Force a generation/stamp wrap at its original mutation point; compare the first post-wrap query with a clean equivalent map. Evidence: [fine map stamp wrap](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fine-stamp-wrap-preserves-complete-engine-request-state), one pre-call seed then original14ad50 increments FFFF/0/1/2 across unchanged fine metadata. All four complete requests and every final node/work/route equal fresh maps and engine C; actual engine storage is reused in both class orders. Spatial/adaptive stamps and allocation capacity retain their existing IDs.
- [x] **MAP-05.3** Trigger reachable allocation failure and metadata/dead-record cleanup thresholds; assert failure result and no surviving partial links. Payoff136: fresh census of all28 original allocation sites and frozen failure/cleanup reports; no recoverable retail failure. Engine real search metadata and2100-record deadline cleanup, fatal mid-update allocation regression and Save121 fine stamps. Unreachable24-bit exhaustion remains explicitly excluded; [integration](retail-pathfinding-storage.md#payoff136-fine-map-integration).

### MAP-06 — Map lifetime

- [x] **MAP-06.1** Destroy and reload a map with a live mover; record which routes, grids and handles are cleared or rebuilt and assert first subsequent movement. Payoff129: complete retail eight-restart/ChangeLevel report,219 observer-free markers and nine original retire/release/destructor cases. Production LoadMap now retires live routes, queues, memberships and borrowed-geometry jobs before replacing world/rows; actual MPQ tests compare public movement across eight restarts and a changed-size level. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#map-replacement-retires-movement-owners-before-world-data). Research handoff: [MAP-06.1](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/MAP-06.1/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **MAP-06.2** Save/load during an active route; determine retained versus rebuilt path state and compare resumed movement with the uninterrupted control. Payoff128: complete retail UI-load four-mover suffixes (308 exact commits), rebuilt chains in save order, 24 original insertion cases, Save118 logical rectangles and actual engine target/blocker order, clipped geometry and four-route saved continuations. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#spatial-load-rebuilds-membership-in-save-order). Proximity query/stamp/maintenance contracts remain SEP-02/03.

## FOOT — Footprints and query policy

Evidence: [footprint evidence][S]. Tools/artifacts: footprints, cells, blockers, grid.

### FOOT-01 — Radius production

- [x] **FOOT-01.1** Authored collision conversion and the four fine-class thresholds are recovered and covered by the footprint oracle. Evidence: [footprints][footprints]; runtime producer coverage is not complete.
- [x] **FOOT-01.2** Change collision radius through a runtime producer; test below/equal/above each class boundary and assert geometry/class changes. Evidence: [payoff51](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#moving-radius-changes-retain-point-motion-and-scalar-owner-deadlines), repeated public Chaos point-Move growth and nine boundary radii, retained canonical mover with new physical owner, exact geometry/class words,1179 ordinary engine commits and4280 Save81 suffix commits. Engine commits old pose, refreshes occupancy/routing, publishes authored speed and defers preserved-task reissue. Other task/locomotion families and group maximum remain their own leaves.
- [ ] **FOOT-01.3** Trace group maximum and target-radius producers; assert updates after the largest member/target changes size or disappears. Local unbound group sampling/cache integration is explicitly split into01.3.1; bound shared7c accumulation, target families and their live lifetime compositions remain here.
- [x] **FOOT-01.3.1** Port the local physical group maximum and retained coarse footprint as distinct producers. Repeat public group Move through largest-member Chaos growth/shrink/removal, compare complete motion plus original path+b4 at every owner, correct the pre-movement owner counter/scheduler phase, and restore both live maximum and cached footprint through Save81. The remaining shared7c/target producer scope stays01.3. Evidence: [payoff52](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#local-group-maximum-and-retained-route-footprint-have-separate-lifetimes), twelve repeated base/read-only footprint captures,831 complete engine commits/730 owner states and2207 motion/2193 owner Save81 suffix states per variant; full debug/release/repository checks,263 Python checks,26 fresh capture contracts and saved Ghidra readback pass.

- [x] **FOOT-01.4** Apply the proven static 1/2/3/4-cell classes to engine fine routing, direct/step endpoint checks and point/group destination correction. Original24 cardinal corridor requests and1,184 complete endpoint validations pass; C endpoint geometry matches at O0/O2. The engine first reproduced16 class/corridor failures, then actual Move orders advance with exact destinations in14 fitting cases. Nearest-ring and Bresenham/corner adapters remain explicit partial policies. Evidence: [engine collision classes](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#retail-collision-classes-reach-routing-and-stepping).
- [x] **FOOT-01.5** Synchronize long/shared routing fields with the same game-owned class geometry. A two-cell winding passage beyond48 cells now admits class1, actual Move ticks advance legally, a one-cell pinch invalidates the generation and separates class0/class1 fields and fallbacks. Correct pending-job scratch lifetime after a synchronous source flood. Existing group/worker/save regressions and both full fixture suites pass. Shared SPFA/interpolation remains the engine algorithm, not retail adaptive hierarchy parity. Evidence: [long field geometry](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#long-fields-use-the-same-class-geometry-as-move).

### FOOT-02 — Passage matrix

- [x] **FOOT-02.1** Run cardinal corridors at width below/equal/above footprint diameter, across four classes, lanes and sub-cell offsets; compare accepted cells and route. Evidence: [complete passage matrix](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#passage-matrix-covers-lanes-footprints-corners-and-offsets), widths0..5 in both axes across four masks/classes/offsets; all original core/repeat/full-request states and C searches agree. Engine compares every original endpoint and admitted complete/partial route; public endpoint correction stays FOOT-04. No added IDs.
- [x] **FOOT-02.2** Extend that matrix to diagonal corners, touching footprints and map edges; retain one minimized counterexample per distinct mismatch. Same [evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#passage-matrix-covers-lanes-footprints-corners-and-offsets):24 rotated L-corner cases, six touching static rectangle gaps, all four edges and four independent lane-bit controls. Entire50-shape/3200-request matrix freezes exact words/cells/routes;6400 production endpoint decisions and2720 admitted route pairs match. No unresolved matrix mismatch to minimize, no new TODOs.

### FOOT-03 — Object query eligibility

- [x] **FOOT-03.1** Build a tag/mask/flag/count truth table for fine search, hierarchy, segment checks and endpoint validation using BASE-02 object categories. Payoff137: shared production raw-cell traversal matches50112 original/model/C cases plus36 terrain cases per-O0/-O2, every object/map stamp, target flag and collector token. Actual engine suppression/activation,49/50 raw-link, full-vector suffix and clockwise hierarchy ordering regressions fail first, then pass. Saved seven-function Ghidra/mapper evidence and controlled Frida captures retained. Static region producer/reference lifetimes remain03.2. [Evidence and limits](retail-pathfinding-categories.md#payoff137-exact-raw-cell-consumer-eligibility). Research handoff: [FOOT-03.1](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/FOOT-03.1/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **FOOT-03.2** Put two different eligible categories in one cell, then remove each in turn; assert query results and remaining reference counts at all four consumers. Payoff138: actual Move-owned sparse collection/raster/retire producers match16 original mixed scenarios/112 states per-O0/-O2, all map/object stamps, consumers and reference counts. Engine insertion/removal permutations, destructable death/restore, fractional publication, flight stamps and Save122 sparse load pass. [Evidence and limits](retail-pathfinding-categories.md#payoff138-widget-regions-and-mixed-lifetimes).

### FOOT-04 — Start and goal policy

- [ ] **FOOT-04.1** Test start inside self, target and unrelated blocker; assert the public caller's clamping, exclusion and first accepted route point.
- [ ] **FOOT-04.2** Test blocked/outside/overlapping goals and target removal; assert perimeter choice, rejection or fallback with original result codes. Ordinary ground point-Move static blocked-goal lifetime is split into04.7; outside/overlap/target and wider mask/class domains remain here.
- [x] **FOOT-04.3** Split ordinary in-map blocked ground SetUnitPosition/Loc point admission from04.2: recover policy2 cell rings, initial attempt budget and first-cell tie order; port32-ring admission and authored nearest-vertex terrain level. Evidence: [blocked placement reaches the engine](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-placement-reaches-the-engine),2304 complete original point calls/1152 endpoints across four masks/classes, two repeated public captures with seven searches/six placements,26 actual public engine assertions with all six retail destinations exact. Bridge overlays, outside-map clipping, rejected-level live controls, broader object categories and terrain-writer native implementation remain04.2/BASE-02/MAP.
- [x] **FOOT-04.4** Port the ordinary embedded-start Stop recovery observed inside public blocked placement. Actual171340 stack14 limit5 invokes170080 with current query,654060/level6 and policy2. Two complete public Stop repeats retain eight calls, three complete searches and24 exact getter words: clear and disabled stay put, embedded recovers, exhausted five-attempt search stays put. Reproduce two engine destination failures, then apply a native-fine recovery point through Move; public Stop/save/load/exhaustion/map-release regression passes29 assertions. Evidence: [engine payoff27](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stop-recovers-an-embedded-mover-with-a-bounded-query). Outside-map, bridge/rejected-level/other-actor and broader caller composition remain04.2/BASE-02/E2E; helper result1 is blocked-source status, not success.

- [x] **FOOT-04.5** Explicitly split ordinary in-map SetUnitPathing/SetUnitPosition queryzero from04.2. Recover current-query getter05ac30/685ef0 and radius getter6742f0; false accepts blocked requested coordinates while preserving footprint bounds and level callback. Two complete five-placement repeats match65 public queries, five commits and seven placement searches;576 original zero-mask calls across288 inputs match C against nonzero authored terrain. Reproduce six engine raw destination failures, then pass65 public-native/Loc/save assertions with all five observed destinations. Evidence: [engine payoff26](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#disabled-query-reaches-public-placement). Other actor forms, outside clipping, rejected-level/bridge controls and full live clock parity remain04.2/BASE-02/E2E.

- [x] **FOOT-04.6** Explicitly split ordinary in-map ground public CreateUnit admission from04.1. Two complete eight-spawn captures recover policy2/32 rings,31-unit footprint/self exclusion and fresh mover sentinel cancellation; all eight endpoints, sixteen writes,104 queries and239 motion decisions replay exactly and repeat. Replace public spawn's64-unit circle spiral through Move-owned admission/initial pose; public CreateUnit/AtLoc, native destinations and saved scheduler continuation pass. Evidence: [engine payoff33](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-spawn-admission-and-initial-mover-pose). Original Loc, other actors/factory flags, bridge/rejected-level/outside controls and full physical crowd cadence remain04.1/02/BASE-02/MAP/E2E.

- [x] **FOOT-04.7** Split the ordinary ground point-Move static blocked-goal lifetime from04.2: repeat the public five-by-five terrain blocker producer, retain the requested click through intermediate routes, partial endpoint, two retries and natural can't-path task cleanup, and port complete motion plus saved continuations in the engine. Evidence: [payoff53](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-point-goals-retain-the-click-through-retry-and-forced-arrival), two fresh originals repeat207 commits; engine mismatch prefixes4/177/203 become207 exact commits plus46 Save82 suffix commits per variant. Stop/replacement clear naturally saved force. Full debug/release/repository checks,274 Python checks,27 fresh capture contracts and saved Ghidra readback pass. Wider masks/classes, outside/overlap and target categories remain their parent tasks.

- [x] **FOOT-04.8** Split the ordinary ground point-Move world-bound clip from04.2: recover05b970's cell-size-times-four margin and ordered scalar bounds, witness before/after near each edge, retain the public click while clipping only routing, and compare original public outside-west full travel plus saved continuations. Evidence: [payoff54](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#outside-point-goals-clip-routing-while-retaining-the-public-click), two fresh original journeys match191 normal engine commits/47 saved suffix commits per variant; two12-input public edge matrices retain raw task versus clipped routing words;108 original prefix/C cases pass. Full debug/release/repository checks,284 Python checks,28 fresh capture contracts plus map oracle and saved553-role/251-ABI Ghidra readback pass. Outside placement, other masks/classes, overlaps and target removal remain04.2.

## FINE — Fine search

Evidence: [fine-search evidence][S]. Tools/artifacts: queue, search, grid.

### FINE-01 — Full searches with objects

- [x] **FINE-01.1** 288 complete static searches plus repeat/stamp reuse pass with exact route/state expectations. Evidence: [static fine searches][fine-static]; mixed dynamic objects remain excluded.
- [x] **FINE-01.2** Compose stationary/moving/suppressed/mixed object chains in all four published ground/flight/float/amph masks and footprint classes.384 original full searches,384 retained-metadata repeats and384 complete requests match production C cost/work/nodes/parent routes at O0/O2 with reuse. Captured stock getter/publication producers establish the mask table; target exit and public endpoint admission retain01.3/FOOT-04. Evidence: [authored movement masks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-movement-masks-reach-terrain-and-object-queries).
- [x] **FINE-01.3** Compose self/suppressed/target identities, collision eligibility, terrain-first rejection and both overlapping cell-link orders across four footprints/masks and budgets0/5/700.2304 original core and complete setup/search/reconstruction requests freeze200 target exits; C matches cost/work/node counts and full parent chains twice at O0/O2. Engine separate active ground targets retain the original approach-node centre, including moving targets; point destinations remain exact. Original public wrapper suppression/restore already has288 composed requests. Evidence: [target identity exits reach the engine](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-identity-exits-reach-the-engine). Runtime cell-link chronology is explicitly split into01.6; categories/building targets remain BASE-02/FOOT-04.

- [x] **FINE-01.4** Port the recovered static search policy into the engine and retain its turns through actual Move steering. All288 original cell routes/costs/pops/node counts match C at O0/O2 with reuse; three blocked wall-gap Move cases retain their turn with a ready generic field. Current radius/corner legality, visible-point adapter, long-route fields and dynamic objects remain separate. Evidence: [engine fine routing](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#retail-fine-search-drives-nearby-detours).

- [x] **FINE-01.5** Port idle ground-object occupancy into location-order direct checks, fine search, waypoint selection and retained-segment validation. Initial actual Move failed to detour; all four classes now pass the fixed idle unit. Moving/idle transitions, overlapping objects, self/target exclusion and unchanged static field generation have regressions.192 original mixed-chain routes/costs/pops/nodes match C at O0/O2; fresh read-only hfoo/hgry captures verify profiles and velocity flags. Interaction queues stay ability-owned; full categories, endpoint admission and partial routes remain separate. Evidence: [engine idle objects](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#idle-objects-affect-nearby-move-routes).

- [x] **FINE-01.6** Preserve actual dynamic cell-link insertion/removal chronology in the engine and observe overlapping target/foreign-blocker queries through public orders. A target before an eligible blocker must report identity even when the cell rejects; a blocker before a target must hide it. Reuse01.3's two original chain-order controls, then capture/repeat the actual producer. Completed with [engine active-cell history](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#overlapping-targets-retain-fine-cell-insertion-history):81,920 native/C active orders, two complete real producer captures and501 exact public commits plus1,999 saved suffix commits per edition. Ordinary pose commits, retained intersections, leave/reentry, removal and Save91 preserve order; native allocation/stamp storage remains MAP-05/06.

### FINE-02 — Search termination

- [x] **FINE-02.1** Compose equal-cost ties, reopenings and stale heap entries in one full request; compare pop order, generations and charged work. Evidence: [full queue composition](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#full-queue-composition-preserves-partial-goal-centres), one natural48x48 request combines886 equal keys, one reopening and190 stale entries;1068 exact ten-word pop records match complete original core/repeat/fractional request, O0/O2 C and repeated actual engine routes. Ordinary700-work control discovers but does not pop the goal, returns50-point centre partial and charges701; two engine endpoint failures are fixed while retaining the click. No new IDs.
- [x] **FINE-02.2** Force budget exhaustion and nearest-node fallback around final-pop boundaries.1456 complete original requests (four classes, ground/flight masks, mixed objects, blocked goal) freeze result/nearest/distance/parent chain/endpoints/work/nodes; C matches at O0/O2 with reuse.177 failures already admit the goal before its denied final pop. Actual Move retains the idle-wall approach, advances and resumes its original destination after blocker removal; known-disconnected static fields keep their component fallback. Public scheduler budget producers and full-coordinate reconstruction beyond supplied backing remain separate. Evidence: [engine partial routes](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#nearest-partial-routes-survive-blocked-goals). Payoff76 additionally fixes the actual700-work admitted-but-unpopped goal endpoint: preserve native centre instead of substituting the fractional click; two reproduced engine word failures become an exact50-point route and701 charged work. [Queue/partial evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#full-queue-composition-preserves-partial-goal-centres).

### FINE-03 — Fine storage lifetime

- [x] **FINE-03.1** Cross node and heap growth/capacity boundaries; verify original failure codes and free-list recovery on the next request. [Payoff90](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fine-storage-growth-and-capacity-preserve-search-results): five unchanged original requests, all-node O0/O2 comparison, natural32,768-identity refusal with partial recovery, independent heap growth,32,769 metadata links recycled, and two complete read-only live constructor/growth captures. Production growable backing retains normal700/2,048-work policy, survives relocation and is released on map teardown; actual local-route regressions and both full edition suites pass. External Storm allocation imports supply host storage; Storm OOM is not claimed.
- [x] **FINE-03.2** Run sequential searches through 16-bit stamp wrap and reuse; compare post-wrap route and node state with a clean control. Same [wrap evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fine-stamp-wrap-preserves-complete-engine-request-state): complete original148100 executes FFFF/0/1/2 across four lanes/classes;1656 final normalized node states, nearest results, work and full fractional routes equal clean controls and C. Actual G_BuildUnitMoveLocalRoute repeats both request orders over retained backing,23928 assertions. Counter seeding is explicit; no65K-history or capacity claim.

### FINE-04 — Public fine results

- [x] **FINE-04.1** All four footprint classes retain original same-cell, blocked-source and blocked-goal setup/build/selected-point/progress outcomes. Engine Move preserves the published fine source and exact fractional same-cell goal with zero nodes/work; retained setup preserves obstruction/class/stamp. Evidence: [payoff91](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fine-setup-and-caller-outcomes-preserve-the-published-source),24 complete original controls plus four reuse controls, O0/O2 exact C buffers and two complete live292-request repeats; both edition suites, production, strict corpus and saved335-ABI Ghidra readback pass.
- [x] **FINE-04.2** All four classes retain disconnected, zero-budget and suppressed-special-target outcomes through original setup/build/selected-point/progress callers, including source-only failure and target-counter restoration. Engine Move records endpoint mismatch independently of search success and retains original partial words. Evidence: [payoff91](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fine-setup-and-caller-outcomes-preserve-the-published-source),24 complete original/C controls, four reuse controls and two whole292-request live repeats with584 C-exact replays; both edition suites and strict corpus pass. Full physical source-recovery/velocity composition remains FOOT/ROUTE/E2E.

## ACC — Adaptive search

Evidence: [adaptive evidence][S]. Tools/artifacts: adaptive, routes; reduced fixture under tools/ghidra/fixtures/.

### ACC-01 — Adaptive expansion

- [x] **ACC-01.1** Enumerate side/corner and level-transition branches from the adaptive expander; record exact input preconditions for each branch. Payoff126 integrates289 Jccs/578 outcomes with exact preconditions:463 reachable,113 rejected by structural/context proofs and two separate caller-domain cases. Saved Ghidra names/26 explicit ABIs, portable disassembly/coverage and C route/full-node regressions support the inventory. The engine side walker prunes only proven-clear interior tests; boundary/corner and ushort-alias fallback remain. Evidence: [handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/ACC-01.1/HANDOFF.md), [engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-branch-witnesses-justify-clear-interior-pruning) and strict oracle-adaptive-witnesses.
- [x] **ACC-01.2** Build one witness per enumerated branch across lanes/classes and special-marker cells; assert promotion/subdivision and neighbor ordering. Payoff126 integrates3,288 complete original producer requests across four lanes, both sizes and marker cells, witnessing463 reachable outcomes and276 transition/clamp targets. Production C compares every result/work/node/warp count and route word in literal and epoch modes; ten rare outcomes retain complete ordered node tables. Fresh original replay equals the full frozen report. Evidence: [handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/ACC-01.2/HANDOFF.md), [engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-branch-witnesses-justify-clear-interior-pruning) and strict oracle-adaptive-witnesses.

- [x] **ACC-01.3** Split ordinary adaptive reimplementation from01.1/02: port setup, clear-parent promotion, mixed-side subdivision, base/coarse neighbor order, both stored sizes, integer distance, nearest partial route and reconstruction into engine long Move. Evidence: [adaptive long Move](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-search-reaches-long-distance-move),712 complete original/C requests across four lanes, exact route words/counts/charged pops/created nodes; actual long detour reaches legal arrival. Branch inventory, special-marker witnesses and producer reachability remain01.1/02 and02.1/02.

### ACC-02 — Classification reachability

- [x] **ACC-02.1** Map classification/flag combinations used by adaptive fixtures back to map producers; classify each as reachable, rejected or unresolved. Evidence: [ordinary reachability inventory](retail-pathfinding-search.md#ordinary-classification-reachability),54 original producer witnesses from16^4 ordinary fine patterns,27 ground/flight-inconsistent tuple rejections and ordinary class3 rejection. Synthetic unrelated-lane words and explicit interventions remain controls; valid selected-lane projections, full constructor/widget/terrain maps and exclusions have identified producers. Special-marker/object domains remain02.2/FOOT-03/GATE. All54 witnesses and full reduced hierarchy match actual engine classification.
- [x] **ACC-02.2** For each unresolved combination, provide a producer-built witness or a documented rejection proof; retain separate IDs if further work is discovered. Payoff126 integrates108 child states,96 original reducer cases,54 parent tuples, marker propagation/erasure and documented producer rejection proofs. C regressions preserve mixed parents over marked clear children and original source/incoming bytes. Saved writer evidence distinguishes a heuristic candidate scan from a proof. No new TODOs are added; object eligibility and caller/alias domains retain their existing owners. Evidence: [handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/ACC-02.2/HANDOFF.md), [engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-branch-witnesses-justify-clear-interior-pruning) and strict oracle-adaptive-witnesses.

### ACC-03 — Size-2 east-boundary veto

- [x] **ACC-03.1** The synthetic size-2 east-boundary veto is reduced and causally isolated. Evidence: [adaptive veto][adaptive-veto]; gameplay reachability remains unproven.
- [x] **ACC-03.2** Construct the reduced veto using real map/request producers, or prove its classification cannot be produced within scope. Evidence: [terrain-produced veto](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#terrain-produced-adaptive-passages-preserve-the-retail-veto),288 actual04d870/054000 setters then full15d360/162cb0 preserve38-pop/56-node partial in all four lanes over2,206 padded hierarchy cells. Ordinary occupancy1/boundary0 and all final nodes/routes equal C; actual owned engine requests repeat twice. Empty storage/headers are supplied explicitly; full mover retry/arrival stays03.3, with known reference difference retained.
- [x] **ACC-03.3** Run the producer-built mover through fallback/retry to arrival or failure and preserve its retail journey. Evidence: [whole passage failure](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#producer-built-size2-passage-reaches-full-retail-failure), two actual file-backed/public Move captures reproduce38-pop group veto, nine searches, two retries, forced arrival and full task/order cleanup short of the click.437 raw motion/facing commits and434 decisions repeat; actual engine normal frames plus six Save90 continuations match437 ordinary/800 suffix commits with12,420 assertions per edition. No scene-conditioned production code or new task IDs. Other task families/objects/portals retain their existing scopes.

### ACC-04 — Adaptive costs

- [x] **ACC-04.1** Compare heuristic, total cost and nearest-node selection with ordinary edges under ties and budget exhaustion; explain each shortest-path difference. Payoff126 compares135,981 original integer-distance inputs,336 ordinary/transposed requests,188 successful graph-optimal costs and157 budget/nearest cases. Production C preserves all route words, goal costs, strict nearest discovery and the four asymmetric cost pairs. Differences from the base-grid optimum follow adaptive geometry/representatives; that grid is not an optimality reference. Evidence: [handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/ACC-04.1/HANDOFF.md), [engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-branch-witnesses-justify-clear-interior-pruning) and strict oracle-adaptive-witnesses.
- [x] **ACC-04.2** Repeat with an active special edge; assert edge cost,parent chain,tie ordering and partial result without assuming optimality. [Payoff95](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#way-gate-special-edges-reach-retained-move-routes) ports4608 complete unchanged native routes/distances across four lanes,two sizes,six budgets,three exits,activation/warp toggles and eight overlap states. Every route,ten-word node,charged work,partial endpoint and warp count matches production C atO0/O2. Accepted special g+1 and ordinary incoming-tag clearing retain native heap policy; distance intentionally checks the parent incoming tag. Actual group/member Move and ten Save99 continuations reproduce410 full commits and3094 saved commits. Wider branch inventory/reachability remain01/02.

### ACC-05 — Adaptive storage lifetime

- [x] **ACC-05.1** Complete original adaptive searches cross2,048-node growth,32,768 identities and ushort65,535/65,536/65,537 aliases; five actual166c30 wrappers retain partial flags/adjusted goals/indices and subsequent-request reset. Explicit4,096-entry original enqueue/pop storage control crosses2,048/4,096 heap growth and preserves every pop, followed by an unchanged public recovery request. Engine dynamic levels/nodes, separate adaptive open growth, ushort metadata and65,536-parent route/save extents match atO0/O2; actual group/owned production requests repeat636 assertions. Evidence: [payoff92](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-storage-grows-beyond-the-fine-identity-limit), six complete searches/five wrappers, two read-only live constructor/initial-growth repeats, both editions, production, six strict contracts and saved Ghidra fields. Storm OOM/naturally occurring live heap saturation are not claimed; fixed256-record special index allocator lifetime remains GATE-04.1/04.2.
- [x] **ACC-05.2** Reuse storage across stamp wrap and lane/class changes; assert no stale node, route or flag survives into the next request. Evidence: [adaptive reuse/flag restoration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-reuse-restores-the-original-ground-classifications), full original162cb0/164c30 increments DWORD FFFFFFFE/FFFFFFFF/0..5 across four ordinary lanes/sizes1/2;511 final semantic nodes/work/fractional routes equal clean controls and C, with asserted lane/size/warp state.3451 actual lazy lookups warm all searchable metadata before the one counter seed; historical billions of requests/cold zero/capacity/special-edge/public scheduler scopes are excluded. Real engine owned routes repeat twice over retained backing. Three native no-fly-only41/0/41 exclusion controls reproduce eight stale engine ground cells/parents; post-exclusion rebuild now uses coarse6 like initial construction, restoring every cached lane/level with8828 assertions. No new IDs.

- [x] **ACC-05.3** Split the engine derived-hierarchy lifetime from retail storage requirements05.1/02: cache four static lanes by bake epoch, refine adaptive legs with live fine occupancy, free on module shutdown and reproduce saved long-Move continuation. Evidence: [adaptive long Move](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-search-reaches-long-distance-move),public terrain-edit lane isolation, repeated lane/size requests,180 saved continuation ticks with exact positions/heading/velocity/order; existing winding-field regression now retains a legal adaptive turn. Retail capacity/growth/stamp-wrap remain05.1/02.

## NUM — Numbers and random state

Evidence: [numeric evidence][P] and [motion][M]. Tools/artifacts: numeric, speed, range, motion, separation.

### NUM-01 — Arithmetic inventory

- [x] **NUM-01.1** 200,330 exact scalar calls, 2,130 normalizations and 864 bounds prefixes are recorded. Evidence: [scalar arithmetic][numeric]; trig and general trajectories remain open.
- [ ] **NUM-01.2** Publish the remaining arithmetic/conversion inventory with original caller sites and evidence/task ownership; link verified scalars and completed paired/decimal/public/angle/Pow slices01.4..6/08/09. Explicit extensions01.10..19 own rounding, shared constant initialization, reachable operand aliases, decimal CRT grammar/locale and nonreturning VM lifetime; compiled literal producers remain01.7. Classify any newly discovered numeric helper into existing evidence or an explicit follow-up leaf.
- [x] **NUM-01.3** Independent integer formula regenerates all 1,025 embedded reciprocal entries exactly; Ghidra references identify a static table consumed by0711e0, with no runtime producer. Same generator also reproduces all 1,025 sine entries. Evidence: [generated tables](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#generated-tables-and-exact-trigonometry), report `scalar-trig-engine-exact.json`; historical build-time source is unavailable.

- [x] **NUM-01.4** Split01.2's paired-trig consumer integration: execute original071340 with raw angle words and verified ECX/EDX/stack4/RET4 ABI, independently regenerated sine table, alias/guard/nonvolatile-register controls and optimized/unoptimized C. Integrate shared phase calculation into production velocity without changing any frozen velocity/facing/position words. Evidence: [paired trigonometry](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#generated-tables-and-exact-trigonometry),20,032 distinct raw angles plus80,128 aliases through original code/C with guards, independent table model and-O0/-O2 regression; frozen digest01131f85... and122/122 unchanged-trajectory corpus outcomes. Remaining conversion/angle-helper ABI and public-domain inventory stays01.2.

- [x] **NUM-01.5** Split01.2's public S2R decimal producer and engine destination integration: recover070de0/071180 grammar/ABI, execute original parser with independent scalar reference, capture actual S2R/helper raw words twice, and preserve parsed public Move coordinates. Evidence: [public scalar inputs](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-scalar-inputs-and-decimal-destinations),2,024 original/model/C parser cases,67-native/25-parser exact repeats with embedded source/map hashes, failing public decimal/Move regression then five passing checks and optimized/unoptimized C. Non-ASCII grammar/locale and distinct compiled literal parsing remain01.2/07.
- [x] **NUM-01.6** Split01.2's registered I2R/R2I/Sin/Cos/Acos/SquareRoot public adapters: retain actual cdecl ABI, integer truncation/saturation and public inverse/root guards, execute original wrapper controls, capture decimal-produced raw inputs/outputs and integrate the verified numerical behavior into engine natives. Evidence: [public scalar inputs](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-scalar-inputs-and-decimal-destinations),12,210 original raw-wrapper cases, repeated public fixture,21 reproduced engine failures followed by41 exact passing words,289 saved Ghidra names/57 prototypes. Other angle/power natives and whole trajectories remain01.2/NUM-02.3.
- [x] **NUM-01.7** Recover original compiled JASS decimal-literal parsing/constant storage separately from S2R; reproduce long fractional/integer prefix overflow and ordinary/negative boundary inputs through actual script compilation, freeze raw native input words, and integrate the verified WC3 producer behavior with regressions while preserving Galaxy's distinct source-number contract. Start from exploratory runtime/num-01.5-inputs-raw.jsonl (long0.6 literal reaches Sin asbf85635d); do not treat helper agreement or S2R parsing as compiler proof. Evidence: [compiled JASS real literals](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#compiled-jass-real-literals), identified925260 and lexer+24/+98 storage,4,064 original/model/C calls per-O0/-O2 with ABI/write guards and digest29ddca0c; repeated32 actual compiled R2I argument/output pairs and40 compiler/token/caller observations. Four reproduced engine word failures precede the port; exact Move coordinates, save/load and mixed JASS/Galaxy source policies pass. Prior numeric expectations now use independent C raw words. Saved336 names/23 layouts/100 prototypes and fresh142/142 corpus. Full lexical grammar and integer tokens remain explicit01.15/16.

- [x] **NUM-01.8** Split01.2's Asin/Atan/Atan2/Tan and degree/radian public adapter integration: preserve exact inverse-table/polynomial operation order, public domain/zero guards, constants and cdecl operand ABI; verify original distinct-storage helpers and repeat real public-native words, then integrate engine adapters. Evidence: [public angle adapters](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-angle-adapters),81,309 original/model/C helper calls,24,420 registered raw-wrapper calls, two identical48-call live captures,25 reproduced engine failures followed by48 exact passing cases, optimized/unoptimized C and saved299 Ghidra names/67 prototypes. Pointer-alias producers, Pow and remaining conversion inventory remain01.2; compiled literals remain01.7.

- [x] **NUM-01.9** Explicitly split01.2's Pow/log/exp implementation: verify original20f990 public guards and0710e0 branching, integer-power wrapping/termination domain, log070f70/06ff20/06fd50 and exp070c20/06fe10 constants/ABI with independent scalar models and optimized/unoptimized C; repeat public-native raw inputs/results and integrate verified terminating Pow calls into engine with test-first regressions. Preserve signed-zero/near-zero and negative-base fractional behavior. Instruction-budget controls must identify nonterminating converted signed exponents without claiming a numeric result or running unbounded live scripts. Remaining ceil/round/alias/init/grammar inventory stays01.2; full trajectory stays02.3. Evidence: [public Pow and exact log/exp arithmetic](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-pow-and-exact-logarithmexponential-arithmetic),24,423 completed original/model/C calls,173 bounded signed-loop controls, two identical40-call public captures and27 reproduced engine failures followed by exact native regressions. Optimized/unoptimized C share digest7cf000cf; engine explicitly reports the unobserved nonreturn domain rather than claiming VM watchdog parity. Saved329 names/93 prototypes/31 globals and fresh138/138 corpus.

- [x] **NUM-01.10** Split01.2's floor/ceil/round/truncate conversion contracts: original ECX/EDX ABI, signed-zero and adjacent-integer boundaries, raw exceptional words, output aliases and independent models/C; retain round's scalar-add-half operation order, original map-dimension caller sites and ceil's actual nonmovement callers. Integrate reusable proven scalar primitives without guessing unobserved gameplay consumers. Evidence: [scalar rounding and shared startup](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#scalar-rounding-and-shared-startup),81,688 exact original/model/C calls per-O0/-O2, unchanged digest0bab35aa, output aliases/ABI guards, saved helper names/prototypes and production raw-word primitives. No unrelated gameplay ceil call is substituted.
- [x] **NUM-01.11** Split01.2's shared scalar constant startup: recover the actual minus-one/zero/one initializer functions and registration order, execute them from poisoned storage without replacing writes, verify exact words and bounded write regions; annotate producers and remove supplied-constant assumptions where these initializers can execute. Other discovered initialization families stay inventory01.2 until assigned explicitly. Evidence: [scalar rounding and shared startup](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#scalar-rounding-and-shared-startup), original registered001dd0/001a80/001b80 entries execute from poisoned storage in CRT table ordera7cdb8..c0; numeric and power oracles preserve guards/ABI and frozen numerical digests. Saved initializer names, globals and99 prototypes; fresh138/138 corpus.
- [ ] **NUM-01.12** Split01.2's reachable operand-alias producers: distinguish helper alias tests from actual pointer relationships in movement callers, reproduce each reachable alias or prove its exclusion, and integrate any observed operation-order difference with regressions.
- [x] **NUM-01.13** Split01.2's decimal CRT grammar/locale: identify the exact sibling CRT digit classifier and active locale producer, compare all relevant byte values and public high-byte inputs, and preserve accepted/rejected domains in the engine parser. Evidence: [public decimal byte grammar](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-decimal-byte-grammar-and-crt-locale), exact shipped CRT isdigit0f1d5, original C-table signed prefix and _wsetlocale1335c ever-changed flag producer;1,409 original classifier and1,020 composed parser/model/C calls per-O0/-O2 with guards. Repeated514 public authored-name/SubString/S2R calls and1,040 classifier observations retain bytes80..ff and exact high-byte Move coordinates. Engine public object-name/hashtable/Move regression passes2,054 assertions; existing ASCII parser is already correct in the observed default C locale. Numeric oracle now executes original CRT instead of an ASCII stub. Saved3 CRT types/8 roles/7 globals/context ABI; strict byte verifier rejects missing bytes, changed locale/identity and misplaced case observations. Alternative locale creation and invalid source syntax are explicitly outside this captured domain.
- [ ] **NUM-01.14** Split01.2's nonreturning power VM lifetime: identify actual public script scheduling/watchdog/error behavior for reachable converted negative signed exponents with bounded process controls, then match the proven engine lifetime/error policy. Keep helper instruction-budget stops separate from VM evidence; no unbounded live script or fabricated numeric result.


- [x] **NUM-01.15** Split01.2's full source-number lexical grammar from the bounded decimal producer01.7: recover original9249d0 numeric DFA/token boundaries and nan/inf/exponent/point/hex-like acceptance or rejection through actual source compilation; preserve source-language distinctions and report invalid syntax in the engine. Recover original constant-token storage/consumption beyond the verified lexer+24 slot where needed; do not infer full compiler equivalence from public native input words. Evidence: [Payoff259](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#jass-numeric-source-boundaries-precede-scalar-conversion-payoff259), original16-state/4096-edge numeric DFA and5139 decisions, two valid source repeats/control and12 invalid-source pairs, actual engine Move/save regressions and preserved Galaxy mode. Full semantic compilation is explicitly outside this numeric-domain closure.
- [x] **NUM-01.16** Split01.2's compiled integer producers925210/925490/925350: decimal/octal/hex lexical token108, ECX lexer/token lengthc4, hex prefix-length stack argument, signed32 accumulation and unary sign boundaries; capture actual oversized decimal/octal/hex constants and I2R native argument words, reproduce host-strtol width/saturation differences, and integrate verified JASS integer parsing while preserving Galaxy and save/load. Keep integer lexer evidence separate from real-token prefix wrapping01.7. Evidence: [compiled JASS integer words](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#compiled-jass-integer-words),16,080 original/model/C calls per-O0/-O2 with guarded token108 and exact digest3affdc0f; repeated44 actual I2R input/output pairs and42 compiler word/radix/prefix/caller observations. Nine engine word failures precede the port; all source/native words, Move/save-load and mixed-language policies pass. Unsigned unary subtraction retains INT_MIN wrapping. Saved340 names/104 prototypes and fresh146/146 corpus. Full invalid-token grammar remains01.15.

- [ ] **NUM-01.17** Split01.12's basic arithmetic/conversion callers: classify reachable Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide/reciprocal/sqrt/fractional/rounding/integer inputs and destinations, retain composed read/write order, and integrate any difference through Move. The original33-function xref inventory records6,898 references; name-only movement filtering is not reachability proof.
- [ ] **NUM-01.18** Split01.12's trig/inverse/paired callers: audit all140 direct references across Sin/Cos/Acos/Asin/Atan/Atan2/Tan/SinCos, include vector-heading1d4c80 and indirect wrapper relationships, observe actual producer pointers, reproduce alias-sensitive stores/sign rereads, and preserve reachable behavior in engine regressions. Acos's three sites and Atan2's26 sites must not be confused with Atan's three sites.
- [ ] **NUM-01.19** Split01.12's Pow/log/exp callers: recover source/output/exponent pointer relationships through all referenced wrappers and internal reductions; compare reachable operation order with guarded original-code witnesses and engine consumers. Original nonreturning VM lifetime remains01.14.
- [x] **NUM-01.21** Explicitly add compiled chained-expression producer parity: the engine additive/multiplicative parser currently associates chained operators to the right (`tick-1-i*20` exposed this during02.8). Recover original bytecode/evaluation order for mixed/chained subtract/divide and typed integer/real expressions, compare actual Move/TimerStart input words, then fix the engine grammar with public-order/save regressions. Existing literal and scalar helper parity does not prove expression parsing. Completed by [compiled expression payoff](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#compiled-expressions-retain-retail-arithmetic-and-evaluation-order): original bytecode17/20..23, two complete27-expression captures, ten operand calls, exact public TimerStart/Move inputs, general parser/operator integration, whole432-commit engine journey and1,825 saved suffix commits per edition. Save92/JSVM8 retain current semantics; full lexical/opcode and arithmetic-fault lifetime scopes remain01.2/15.


- [x] **NUM-01.20** Split01.18's actual vector-heading/Acos producer: prove1d4c80's quotient/destination separation through original pointer observations and negative helper-alias controls, compare complete16f630 with guarded external output aliases, confirm the same live movement call chain, and retain exact engine heading words. Other trig callers remain01.18. Evidence: [vector-heading operand relationships](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#vector-heading-operand-relationships),5488 guarded original/model/C producer cases per-O0/-O2 and repeated191 actual nested heading chains (181 negative inputs). Existing engine heading words remain correct.

### NUM-02 — Branch-sensitive arithmetic

- [x] **NUM-02.1** Sine/cosine and acos compare exact output words across cardinal/oblique inputs and adjacent lookup thresholds; independently generated consumed tables match retail. Signed-zero, cancellation and opposite-heading signs are retained. Evidence: [exact vector headings](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#exact-vector-headings), reports `scalar-trig-engine-exact.json`, `acos-engine-exact.json`, `heading-chain-engine-exact.json`; 1,287 composed heading errors plus 183 live errors. Remaining helper inventory belongs to NUM-01.2, whole trajectory to NUM-02.3.
- [x] **NUM-02.2** Original 80 velocity commits and 2,384 position integrations now compare exact C output words; fresh live turn capture compares all 192 velocity/position commits, including stopping. Evidence: [exact velocity integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#velocity-and-position-integration), reports `velocity-integration-engine-exact.json` and `runtime/velocity-turn-exact.json`. Extension: `world-velocity-engine-exact.json` and `retail-world-velocity-1.27.json` freeze1,040 complete original/world-adapted commits and3,344 integrations, including adjacent tiny-speed guards. Move converts velocity inputs to fine-grid units before its cutoff. Committed facing is closed separately by NUM-02.4; whole-engine cadence remains excluded.
- [ ] **NUM-02.3** Extend exact movement to fixed long oblique trajectories at small/large valid values; compare every committed position and cell crossing. Partial engine evidence: [payoff34](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#clear-public-routes-retain-native-waypoints) compares247 public spawn-to-Move commits plus21 supplied-phase saved fractional commits; [payoff35](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-timer-admission-reaches-move-from-zero) reproduces the same247 rows from zero clock through normal periodic callbacks and76 saved continuation commits. That scene's phase producer closes02.8. Payoff36 closes02.12's three stock-shaped public long-oblique/small-large lifetimes and singleton intermediate handoffs through GROUP-04.9:689 exact commits and260 saved continuation commits under supplied observed scene geometry. Other profiles, general timer deadlines, actual scene/scenery producers and full physical groups remain required.
- [x] **NUM-02.4** Verify committed facing from resulting velocity, its tiny-speed guard/equality and stopped-heading remainder normalization; compare original/C/live words. Evidence: [committed facing](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#committed-facing-and-remainder-arithmetic), reports `fraction-modulo-engine-exact.json`, `facing-chain-engine-exact.json`, `facing-stock-turn-fresh-exact.json`;810 heading guards,44 angle boundaries,140 full commits and184 fresh live commits. Accepted-step engine regressions cover oblique facing and fine-grid scale; original full owner cadence/steering state remains open.
- [x] **NUM-02.5** Explicitly split retained native fine pose from the large02.3 clock/trajectory task: integrate and preserve fine words between accepted Move commits, publish through the original scalar world inverse, and retain those words across save/load. Evidence: [retained fine pose](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#retained-fine-pose-reaches-move),288 complete original supplied-.1 commits over18 sequences,139 differ from direct world integration; repeated O0/O2 comparisons and actual16-step Move/save/rejection/reposition/arrival regressions. Original public clock cadence, old-velocity phase and forced-position producers remain02.3/BASE-01.4.


- [x] **NUM-02.6** Split the primary source/owner clock and previous-velocity phase from02.3: recover and repeat the5ms source/six-advance owner cadence, port scheduled point Move and between-callback prediction, then preserve clock/pose/phase across save/load and interruptions. Evidence: [primary clock reaches Move](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#primary-clock-reaches-move-and-predicted-positions),6000 complete original/C advances,1944 boundary/pause/epoch controls,1000 original controlled commits,300 original queries, two identical primary/live movement sequences and an actual30-second engine trajectory matching2100 words. Production public Move/save/pause/stun/Stop/region and queued-Patrol regressions pass. Save63, persistent Ghidra clock prefix/prototypes,195-entry corpus and67 frozen fixtures are synchronized. Full original routes, other ability clocks and small/large public producer trajectories remain02.3/ROUTE/MOVE.

- [x] **NUM-02.7** Explicitly split native route-source/heading consumption from02.3's full producer/cadence trajectory. Trace05bdd0→16a790→16fbd0/16fd3b, retain native source through route queries, and reproduce the complete controlled wall detour plus save/load at four world origins. Evidence: [engine payoff21](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#native-route-inputs-survive-world-projection),174 genuine reproduced failures then1,364 exact assertions, saved vector-input ABI/comment readback. Actual original primary-owner timeline, stock profile/other lanes, adaptive refill and cell-boundary admission remain02.3/FOOT/ROUTE.

- [x] **NUM-02.8** Explicitly split ordinary periodic public admission from02.3: start the engine clock/phase at zero, drive eight public RemoveUnit/CreateUnit/Move lifetimes through normal TimerStart, compare all247 original clock/position/velocity/facing commits and preserve the timer across saved fractional travel and later births. Evidence: [payoff35](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-timer-admission-reaches-move-from-zero), two repeated6000-primary-advance/1000-owner captures; engine elapsed-time cursor and owner-before-authored-timer primary-quantum fixes;76 exact saved continuation commits. Save72 and persisted TimerStart ABI/comments are synchronized. General scalar timer deadlines, other profiles and long small/large trajectories remain02.3/9..11.
- [x] **NUM-02.9** Split the newly exposed timer timeout producer: recover TimerStart's scalar scheduling path and TimerGetElapsed/Remaining/Timeout domains, retain timeout words instead of integer-millisecond truncation, compare short/negative/large input boundaries and port the verified deadlines/getters through actual timer-issued Move. Payoff118 composes the completed02.9.1/02.9.2/02.11 scope with whole original dispatcher controls, two complete native mutation scenes and exact175 engine motion/348 callback getter rows plus856 saved suffix commits. Public retirement and resumed authored follow-up are implemented, with queued-generation and pending-release/save regressions. See [callback mutation](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#timer-callback-mutations-preserve-heap-order-and-deferred-release).
- [x] **NUM-02.9.1** Split the long runtime-radius matrix's positive periodic timer dependency: recover scalar rearm from the due timer clock, preserve the authored0.10 timeout word and the separate owner3cf5c290 period, port both deadline cursors with save/load, and compare the complete90-second public Move/radius matrix. Ghidra053630 and new read-only rearm witnesses establish the producer; engine prefix previously diverged after41seconds with integer cadence. Evidence: [payoff51](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#moving-radius-changes-retain-point-motion-and-scalar-owner-deadlines), two repeated read-only original witnesses each retain3000 owner plus899 public scalar rearms; complete1061-commit engine matrix and4026 saved suffix commits per variant now match. General timeout/getter, pause, heap and epoch domains remain02.9.2/10/11.
- [x] **NUM-02.9.2** Short/zero/negative/large/adjacent public timeout/getter domains, effective scalar duration and paused remainder. Payoff117 ports original120-second counted requests, minimum38d1b717 and operation ordering; two complete read-only captures repeat13692 public/17328 scalar getters each. Real JASS hashtable exports match all351×13×3 words and actual getter-driven Move across the epoch, with five saved continuations. Earlier payoff116 authored-timeout evidence is preserved. General shared-deadline mutation/catch-up remains02.10. See [counted timer clocks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#counted-timer-requests-use-their-own-scalar-clock).
- [x] **NUM-02.10** Split periodic rearm and shared-deadline mutation: recover registration/tie order, overdue catch-up, zero/subquantum periods, restart/pause/destroy inside callbacks and queued generation invalidation; compose original controls, bounded live public Move and saved engine continuation. Ordinary owner-before-map-timer order is02.8, not a full heap-order proof. Payoff118 composes the completed02.9.1/02.9.2/02.11 scope with whole original dispatcher controls, two complete native mutation scenes and exact175 engine motion/348 callback getter rows plus856 saved suffix commits. Public retirement and resumed authored follow-up are implemented, with queued-generation and pending-release/save regressions. See [callback mutation](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#timer-callback-mutations-preserve-heap-order-and-deferred-release).
- [x] **NUM-02.11** Timer-clock epoch/rebase integration. Original052170 subtracts span from every queued raw deadline after draining the old span, then increments epoch. Whole26 original rebase words and two native350-second getter-driven Move lifetimes cross the300-second wrap; actual engine320 commits and1113 saved suffix commits match. Save113/JASS9 retain counted request/deadline/sequence, timer publication and borrowed callback clock; derived indexed heap/active C-timer set rebuild on load. General heap mutation remains02.10. See [counted timer clocks](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#counted-timer-requests-use-their-own-scalar-clock).

- [x] **NUM-02.12** Explicitly split the normal public long-oblique producer from02.3: drive three baseline/near-zero/large-coordinate CreateUnit/Move lifetimes through a periodic timer from clock/phase zero, compare every original pose/velocity/facing/clock commit and save/reload during first-leg travel and the intermediate stop. Evidence: [payoff36](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-oblique-move-retains-the-singleton-group-destination), two complete scene45 captures plus an unchanged read-only geometry witness,689 exact commits and260 original saved continuation commits. Captured stock Misc clamps100 to150; supplied terrain-plus-static scene geometry is explicit. Save73 and Ghidra group/member roles/selector ABI are synchronized. General profiles, timer deadlines, scene/scenery loading and full group phases remain02.3/9..11/GROUP-04.6/MAP.


### NUM-03 — Exceptional numeric inputs

- [ ] **NUM-03.1** Drive negative and out-of-range coordinates/radii through public producers; record rejection, sanitization or propagated bit pattern.
- [ ] **NUM-03.2** Do the same for nonfinite values; document producer unreachability where demonstrated instead of treating synthetic helper calls as gameplay evidence.

### NUM-04 — Random state

- [x] **NUM-04.1** Shared-owner initialization, full-word wrap and overlap/retry draw order traced through public producers. Separate startup/TLS streams remain04.5/06; [payoff101](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-retry-and-overlap-draws-preserve-complete-movement).
- [x] **NUM-04.2** Repeat original interleaving retains48 ordered draws and the full state/motion stream; engine matches1361 commits,830 separation visits,91 retries and12667 saved suffix commits; [payoff101](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-retry-and-overlap-draws-preserve-complete-movement).
- [x] **NUM-04.3** Port the two-word owner generator and exact overlap-direction words.1,408 complete original/C calls and11 seed prefixes, saved Ghidra state/prototypes; [engine payoff17](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#deterministic-owner-random-state-reaches-public-natives).
- [x] **NUM-04.4** Port public seeded integer/real query consumers and save/load continuation. Actual compiled JASS550 original-word assertions plus saved next results; full-width crash and reversed/near-equal bounds covered; Save65.
- [x] **NUM-04.5** Recover map/default seed production and initialization order before the first pathfinding consumer; compare actual actor-startup state. Payoff171 integrates actual default locked and stored-host unlocked seeding, native race preference replacement and logical player order. Five map-load profiles match initial owner/race/JASS words, first movement and saved continuation; ten retail observations reconstruct1611 owner/530 purpose-stream draws. See [startup seeding](retail-pathfinding-startup-seed.md).
- [x] **NUM-04.6** Recover693710’s45 per-game purpose streams and TLS producer; replace the legacy seed side effect with owned saved states. Payoff172 ports both complete seed producers, saves all45 positions, and routes public random-item selection through purpose35. Original56-call oracle, all530 archived purpose draws and actual startup/reseed/query/save regressions pass. Audio/presentation never enters the path owner; broader ability-consumer migration is not claimed. See [purpose RNG ownership](retail-pathfinding-purpose-random.md).


## ROUTE — Route progression and yielding

Evidence: [route evidence][R]. Tools/artifacts: routes, refill, segment, yield, transition.

ROUTE-01.3 explicitly splits the engine fine reconstruction port and its expanded
eight-direction word corpus from01.1's remaining coarse/all-class endpoint scope.

### ROUTE-01 — Reconstruction

- [x] **ROUTE-01.1** Complete2664 original fine/10656 coarse producer requests across all classes/lanes and oblique directions; exact reconstruction order, rounding, partial endpoints and bypasses match production C at O0/O2.200 actual Move adapter rows pass2586 assertions. Owned-array advancement removes whole-chain copies without changing words or Save122 layout. See [Payoff140](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#oblique-reconstruction-and-direct-owned-consumption-payoff140); buffer/public advance state remains01.2.
- [x] **ROUTE-01.2** Empty/partial/denied buffers, unsigned consumer indices, initialized invalid starts,128→256 growth and exact following advances. Payoffs141/142 port retained search/storage and independent coarse/fine caches; Payoff143 adds56 invalid scenarios/112 complete engine member decisions with exact owner RNG and fixes stale unsaved query history on load. Repeated UI loads plus observer-free control verify fresh search owners; saved curves remain usable. Cold outside calls with no accepted history do not establish a safe native return or physical recovery. See [Payoff143](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#invalid-start-consumers-and-fresh-search-owners-after-load-payoff143); [research handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/ROUTE-01.2/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **ROUTE-01.3** Port fine reconstruction coordinates and endpoint replacement into Move's nearby route adapter.3840 original eight-direction parent chains match raw C coordinate words with reuse at O0/O2; exact source, one-node source-before-goal and matching/nonmatching destination cells are explicit. Eight actual engine endpoint failures are reproduced/fixed across four classes. The partial-wall Move now keeps a fractional original goal through obstruction/removal/resume. Coarse reconstruction and buffer growth remain01.1/01.2. Evidence: [fine route endpoints](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#exact-fine-route-endpoints). Payoff34 also retains native fine waypoints in clear location routes instead of subtracting final published world positions; actual spawn-to-Move regression and repeats are [recorded here](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#clear-public-routes-retain-native-waypoints).

### ROUTE-02 — Segment checks

- [x] **ROUTE-02.1** Sweep static segment direction/length across four classes and ground/flight masks, including exact corner endpoints and length1 boundaries. All43,244 original sampler results/cell sequences match C at O0/O2;8,064 short segments query no cells. Original software normalizer words and123 supplied-chain waypoint selection/commit calls match. Engine direct/step/retention checks and fine waypoint selection consume the port; four first-sample strip misses are reproduced/fixed and actual wall-gap steering retains original choices. Endpoint admission and dynamic eligibility remain FOOT-04/FINE-01.2/03 and02.2. Evidence: [engine sampler and waypoints](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#retail-segment-sampling-and-waypoint-selection).
- [x] **ROUTE-02.2** Hit blocker candidate capacity with ordered objects, then change one obstruction between samples; assert cap/order and the resulting waypoint choice. Payoff125 integrates the [research handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/ROUTE-02.2/HANDOFF.md):72 complete original strip/cap calls,14 resolver compositions,288 selector calls, four edit sequences,16 flag contrasts and eight target cases. Engine regressions check reverse-publication first32 order, persistent peer20/requester4 waits, successive edits and diagonal repeated/null tokens; target suppression now ends with fine construction. S/O/C evidence, saved Ghidra and strict corpus. Live crowd reachability and lazy-link chronology remain existing FINE/E2E items. See [engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-blockers-return-after-fine-route-construction).

- [x] **ROUTE-02.3** Explicitly split ordinary fine-curve initial/progress consumption from the remaining route mode, buffer and yielding tasks. Port count-2 initialization,0.49-cell retention and visible-successor progress into Move; match a complete controlled original34-tick wall detour's position/velocity/heading/index words and22 saved continuation ticks. Evidence: [engine payoff20](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#retained-fine-routes-reproduce-a-complete-retail-detour), frozen trajectory and two fresh original replays. Nonzero origin, real original owner cadence, adaptive refill, dynamic yielding and pooled cleanup remain NUM-02.3/ROUTE-01.2/03..05.

- [x] **ROUTE-02.4** Explicitly split initial adaptive-to-fine destination selection from full refill/yield composition. Replace visibility/distance-clamp coarse selection with original167ae0 ten-accelerator-unit reverse-chain consumption and167d70 index-zero current-destination policy. Reproduce64 engine failures, then match all fine-route words in48 complete original165ae0 cases across three64-cell maps, four classes and four lanes. Public Move consumes the original solid-wall local leg while retaining its final order goal. Evidence: [engine payoff23](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-handoff-uses-retail-route-length), two full original buffer replays and1,456 original/C selector cases atO0/O2. Retained coarse progress, owner scheduling, dynamic refills/yielding and portal execution remain ROUTE-03..05/SCHED/GATE.

### ROUTE-03 — Dynamic route composition

- [x] **ROUTE-03.1** Payoff163: eight complete public insertion/removal/terrain/moving-peer scenes reproduce8,189 owner steps, refill indices, request timestamps, charged work and eventual retirement. Failing regressions expose retry leakage at the next group waypoint and a missing singleton intermediate endpoint transition; shared Move handling fixes both. Explicit work comparisons also expose premature destination replacement; Move retains the old path destination until both request timestamps permit the new one. Retained-table cold saves continue identically. [Integration/evidence](retail-pathfinding-composed-blockers.md).
- [x] **ROUTE-03.2** Payoff163: public RemoveUnit during waiting, partial-leg travel or later, plus terrain reopening, retain native countdown/refill timing and final arrival or cannot-path retirement through full owner frames. Cold-load continuations preserve later scripted edits/removal and route state. Strict complete capture verification retains the unchanged original ROUTE-03.2 windows and controls. [Integration/evidence](retail-pathfinding-composed-blockers.md).

- [x] **ROUTE-03.3** Explicitly split retained ordinary coarse progress and admitted static fine refills from03.1's dynamic blocker/yield composition. Preserve original coarse buffers/indices, test .49-accelerator-unit approach before fine progression, invalidate/refill fine storage at the selected following destination and preserve both buffers across Save68. Reproduce64 engine transition failures; all32 complete original admitted controlled-source refills match every native fine word. The actual long public Move scheduler retains its coarse state and repeats180 saved continuation frames exactly after rebinding the rebuilt world's runtime cache epoch. Evidence: [engine payoff24](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#retained-coarse-progress-refills-the-fine-route). Denied-request timing, nonzero next indices, full retail physical multi-tick motion, dynamic blockers/yielding and portals remain03.1/2/04/05/SCHED/GATE.

- [x] **ROUTE-03.4** Explicitly split03.3's nonzero following-index exclusion and newly discovered fine-index producer from dynamic refill/yield timing. Thirty-two full original128-cell routes retain their complete coarse buffers through160 admitted refills, including5→4→3→2→1→0 and9→8→7→2→1→0. Reproduce160 engine index failures; port original observed-obstruction latch and destination-vs-parent initial index. All192 initial/refill buffers, indices and outputs match every word;480 full original/C latch checks and O0/O2 frozen replay pass. Actual public long Move crosses multiple coarse transitions, reaches the legal goal and repeats260 saved frames with exact native/world pose, velocity, heading, order and both route indices. Evidence: [engine payoff28](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#successive-long-refills-select-the-original-fine-index). Full physical retail motion, denied requests, dynamic blockers/yielding and portals remain03.1/2/SCHED/GATE.

### ROUTE-04 — Route mode combinations

- [ ] **ROUTE-04.1** Create a truth table for cached/exhausted/disabled routes and alternate index initialization; cover every reachable combination through public advance. **Payoff113:** complete original165ae0 verifies576 cached/exhausted/disabled/wait combinations; fix the engine's incorrect rejection of cached count1. Two complete public four-class fine-result repeats preserve292 requests each, including single-point creation. **Payoff114:** the four public same-cell routes remain cached through seven commits each; full engine replay and five saved suffixes match all28 native commits. Also remove fresh count1 rejection based on fine_target pointer provenance. Every other public cache/alternate-index combination remains open; see [public single-point lifetime](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-single-point-lifetimes-preserve-cached-motion).
- [ ] **ROUTE-04.2** Exercise queued paths, forced arrival and target-perimeter exit against that table; assert destination, event and retained route state.

### ROUTE-05 — Yielding lifecycle

- [x] **ROUTE-05.1** Trace blocker identity and group-bit-8 producers; assert delay duration after blocker removal and replacement by a reused handle. Payoff162 connects the existing selected formation policy to the actual moving-blocker resolver; ten failing-first assertions now match native ordinary requester4 versus Alt peer20 decisions, including cold save. Public RemoveUnit, four/twenty owner visits, saved continuation and actual edict-slot reuse pass252 assertions. Ten archived Frida observations, two controls and380 unchanged frozen owner records verify the identity/generation and countdown contract. UI input clocks/late one-ulp repeat differences and the single near-replacement observation are retained explicitly; full composed trajectories remain ROUTE-05.2/E2E. See [yield lifecycle](retail-pathfinding-yield-lifecycle.md).
- [x] **ROUTE-05.2** Payoff163: complete same/different-player asymmetric crossing/tunnel and three-mover convergence scenes reproduce1,692 ordered member steps, committed numerical motion, four/twenty countdowns, blocker identities, release order, request timestamps/work and final arrival/failure, including cold-load continuations. Original168360 edge-creation rules exclude persistent yield cycles; the three-member fixture exercises the resulting chain. Nineteen archived observations, seven controls, five full repeats and539 original owner records verify together across ROUTE-03/05. [Integration/evidence](retail-pathfinding-composed-blockers.md).

- [x] **ROUTE-05.3** Explicitly split the verified ordered velocity decision and ordinary engine wait consumer from05.1's group-bit8/reused-handle producers and05.2's full cycles. Port committed-velocity software comparison, ordered persistent peer side effects and max4/20 delays into Move; collect the native next-step class strips and preserve waits/blocker references through Save69. All8,640 original decision cases and25 gate controls match C. Two fresh source/map-pinned crowd captures repeat2,503 complete ordered decisions,51 duplicates,56 short/10 long assignments and424 retiring advances exactly. The public two-Move/remove/query0/save regression consumes four scheduled waits and repeats48 state words, while field tests reject invalid blocker pointers. Evidence: [engine payoff30](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ordered-moving-waits-reach-ordinary-move), frozen original fixtures, saved Ghidra names/ABIs and strict four-entry corpus. Lazy overlapping cell-link order, original group-bit8/membership producers, peer-wait retry restoration, denied requests, acquisition-time waypoint composition and full crowd/cycle trajectories remain ROUTE-02.2/03/05.1/05.2/GROUP/SCHED/E2E. Payoff31 strengthens this existing leaf without adding a checkbox:1,008 complete original countdown callers and two424-call live repeats match C; eight world-heading failures are fixed by retaining the predicted native source. The public oblique-wait/save regression repeats120 state words and resumes movement. Evidence: [native waiting headings](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#waiting-headings-preserve-the-native-caller), saved192-prototype Ghidra readback and fresh four-entry corpus. Payoff32 additionally ports actual peer20 fine retry: restore final-goal native heading, stop requester, reset fine buffers while preserving coarse count/index/points and save71 retry state; public scheduler continuation repeats1440 words.336/2016 complete original/C cases and two97-call live repeats certify native distance/owner-state semantics. Terrain/idle/ineligible vector retries still require original source-footprint admission/recovery; terminal/perimeter and full cycles stay open. Evidence: [peer retry payoff](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#payoff32-blocked-fine-leg-retry-and-retained-coarse-plan).

## TARGET — Pursuit and arrival policy

Evidence: [target evidence][R] and [range][M]. Tools/artifacts: target, refresh, replan, range.

### TARGET-01 — Arrival inputs

- [x] **TARGET-01.1** Point-task range has 4,957 exact cases; object range has 948 calls and six invalid-handle probes. Evidence: [range predicates][ranges]; this does not close their gameplay producers.
- [ ] **TARGET-01.2** Trace remaining target/command range, heading, force and stop parameters from actual commands; test equality and adjacent boundary values. Ordinary zero-range point Move is independently closed01.4; Patrol, AttackMove, occupied destinations and force/can't-path producer decisions remain here and their owning order tasks.
- [x] **TARGET-01.3** Trace one ability-specific approach producer and contrast its range/stop contract with those commands. Payoff185 integrates actual ground Holy Light: authored unbuffered range, nonpersistent physical approach, exact50-row fine motion and retail final public stop; repeated/control producer evidence, non-stock schemas, cancellation and Save146 pass. Target Move retains its distinct configured persistent range. See [spell approaches](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#spell-approaches-capture-a-physical-stopping-range-payoff185). Complete spell timing, perimeter and other target families remain in their existing tasks.
- [x] **TARGET-01.4** Split ordinary zero-range point Move from01.2: capture actual range publication, predicted-pose predicate and final stop; port them into the owning Move ability. Evidence: [point Move arrival](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#point-move-arrival),2342 complete original/C predicate cases, two identical183-evaluation/commit live witnesses, failing actual-order engine regressions then corrected range/heading gate and previous-velocity final step. Full world/grid/clock phases, other owners and force producers remain01.2/3/NUM-02.3; the rejected first observer capture stays explicit.

### TARGET-02 — Target mutations

- [ ] **TARGET-02.1** Extend the bounded ground Smart Follow producer closed02.4 to delayed changed-cell timestamp producers, target visibility/loss, other target-order families, masks and arbitrary scenes; assert cached destination, refresh cadence and admission/replan timing per tick. Payoff164 integrates member/group destination readiness, same-bucket retention, discarded premature samples, and denied-owner refresh/stop with save/load. The complete235-state public walled Smart approach plus85-state saved suffix matches raw retail words; wider target families, masks and visibility/loss compositions remain open. See [target delays](retail-pathfinding-target-delays.md).
- [x] **TARGET-02.2** Resize a target during an active Follow route through original public Chaos; verify changed canonical mover radius, retained group range and fresh route acceptance. Evidence: [payoff50](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#follow-retains-active-range-and-admits-resized-targets-with-half-edge-approaches), five twice-captured growth/shrink/control/research journeys,5075 exact normal engine commits and9725 Save80 suffix commits. Ability-owned deferred type rebind consumes authored Cha1/UnitID, inherits or explicitly clears requirements, preserves public/edict identity and updates collision. Fresh growth approach uses half predicted edge distance; persistent range uses the new radii. Moving-unit radius/occupancy and other body/locomotion families remain FOOT-01.2/03; this stationary-target mutation does not close those domains. Teleports are completed02.5.
- [x] **TARGET-02.3** Kill/remove and then reuse the target handle; assert cancellation/revalidation without adopting the replacement entity. Evidence: [payoff48](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#follow-cancels-synchronously-before-target-pool-reuse), four complete read-only native captures (two per public retirement mode), actual same mover address/public handle with fresh canonical generation,948 exact normal-frame commits per engine journey and3492 total Save80 suffix commits. Move owns death notification and physical-group detachment; replacement stays unadopted until explicit Smart. Wider queued/combat parents and reentrant callbacks remain their owning tasks.
- [x] **TARGET-02.4** Explicitly split visible friendly ground Smart Follow with target point travel and mid-route speed change from02.1. Integrate physical approach/persistent owners, radius-sum range, cached destination bucket and countdown into Move. Evidence: [payoff47](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#smart-follow-tracks-a-moving-target-through-a-speed-change), two complete read-only native witnesses with identical1015 absolute commits,1015 exact normal-frame engine commits and2595 Save80 suffix commits; ten strict fresh contracts, corrupted-state controls and saved Ghidra role/signature/xref readbacks. Authored Stop bounds Follow; natural user-head completion is not claimed. Delayed timestamps, visibility/loss, structures/flight, combat, wider masks and maps remain02.1/02.2/02.3 and their owning tasks.
- [x] **TARGET-02.5** Explicitly split public target SetUnitX/Y and SetUnitPosition teleportation from02.2. Exercise jumps during target point travel and after target arrival while Smart Follow remains active; verify accepted cached destinations, retained radius-sum range and setter order policy. Evidence: [payoff49](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#follow-tracks-public-target-teleports-without-premature-point-settling), eight complete read-only native captures,4091 exact engine commits/7872 saved suffix commits, and a reproduced/fixed legacy near-goal Hold after a turn wait. Same-clock movement commits are now observed before JASS timer writes; saved checkpoints end at owner-quantum boundaries. Collision resizing, denied delayed replans, structures/flight and wider queued/combat domains remain their owning tasks.

### TARGET-03 — Visibility policies

- [x] **TARGET-03.1** Map visibility policy flags/global producers to fog, invisibility and validation results 0xa9/0xaa; publish the reachable branch table. Payoff251 integrates original-policy matrix, lifecycle writers, frozen branch table and optional Move admission regressions. Research handoff: [TARGET-03.1](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/TARGET-03.1/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **TARGET-03.2** Run loss and reacquisition for each listed policy; assert retained pursuit or cancellation and resulting order/route state.

### TARGET-04 — Delayed refresh

- [ ] **TARGET-04.1** Trace refresh-threshold and Captain AI extra-delay producers; assert actual simulation ticks to the next request.
- [x] **TARGET-04.2** Payoff196: complete repeated47-stage original two/three-member retries with bridge range changes, normal completion resetting the counter, terminal per-member failures and following preparation. Production stage fixture matches flags/ranges/counters/events; public unreachable Holy Light failing-first regression fixes blocked receiver success and preserves queued continuation. Two actual Frida observations match186 public markers against an unhooked control. Controlled long-lifetime inputs remain labelled; public range producer breadth stays TARGET-01.2. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#long-member-retries-preserve-range-and-failure-outcomes-payoff196).

## SCHED — Scheduling and owner updates

Evidence: [movement evidence][M] and [routes][R]. Tools/artifacts: scheduler, motion, order_tasks.

### SCHED-01 — Clock domains

- [ ] **SCHED-01.1** Trace both clock selectors and configured spans to simulation time; assert pause, scaling and ordinary advancement against a fixed event timeline.
- [x] **SCHED-01.2** Cross clock rollover and a reachable backward-time transition; assert request deadlines, integration and admission behavior. Payoff261: natural public getter-driven movement crosses300s with exact poses; UI load restores absolute requests and backward movement/save suffixes. A new original-code composition and production save regression preserve all four FIFO policies, retry timestamps and elapsed words across rollover. Existing behavior was correct; no old expectations changed. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#clock-rollover-preserves-path-admission-state-payoff261).

### SCHED-02 — Owner pass ordering

- [x] **SCHED-02.1** Singleton wall trajectory: 44 complete owner updates, all 64 scheduler buckets, visual settling and unlink pass. Evidence: [singleton owner][owner], report M `move_owner_arrival_cases=1`; shared/separation lists empty.
- [x] **SCHED-02.2** Active singleton plus eligible repulsor: 43 separation updates and four accepted attempts pass. Evidence: [separation pair][pair], M `move_owner_active_separation_cases=1`; controlled profile, bounded numeric tolerance.
- [x] **SCHED-02.3** Populate two groups and the shared-cap/radius lists in one owner tick; assert scheduler/publication/group/movement/separation order and same-tick visibility. [Payoff190](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#populated-owner-phases-and-retained-visit-storage-payoff190):1,000 complete repeated live owner intervals include328 shared publications,357 ordered radius visits,32 joint12+1 ticks and1,000 post-movement separation visits; all304 public markers match control. Engine fixes radius traversal to newest-first and retains geometric frozen-generation visit storage; failing-first public Captain/separation construction regression covers phases and zero warm allocation. Callback mutation remains02.4; no new task is added.
- [x] **SCHED-02.4** [Payoff194](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#completion-callbacks-preserve-traversal-and-retirement-boundaries-payoff194): real public Channel callback removes a moving peer and replaces the caster with Move inside16d4e0/16c150/15aa80. Two complete read-only repeats and observer-free control agree on126 markers and400 owner intervals: later peer retires that tick; new owner waits one visit; completed old owner retires next preparation. Original16c390 walks stored rows forward. Engine now dispatches ready callbacks forward and retains emptied completed owners until next preparation. Failing-first actual callback mutation and public Holy Light/save regressions pass Classic/TFT; saved Ghidra fields/comments and portable mappings accompany the fix. Full private stale-row layout remains GROUP-04.6; complete public spell-event timing remains ORDER-01.13.
- [x] **SCHED-02.5** Explicitly split primary-clock singleton route composition from02.1/NUM-02.3. Two complete original wall detours agree on all34 pose/velocity/heading/index/elapsed/clock rows under six authentic5ms advances per pass;45 owner updates include the supplied freshclock0 callback and nine settling ticks. Actual engine RunFrame matches every active motion/clock word and22 saved continuation ticks. Evidence: [primary-owner engine differential](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#primary-owner-clocks-reproduce-the-complete-detour), frozen primary-owner route and strict repeat corpus. Initial public order-admission phase, stock profiles, rendered presentation and populated groups remain separately required.

### SCHED-03 — Admission queues

- [x] **SCHED-03.1** Trace class/priority producers, including non-unit class15; record which runtime object can enqueue into each policy bucket. [Payoff103](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-priority-keeps-the-groups-search-quota) verifies target priority before route reuse while preserving group quota5000. [Payoff104](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#non-unit-path-producers-share-scheduler-class15) identifies all four explicit non-unit sites through five original RTTI classes, records actual class15 fine searches from public Aspa attacks in two complete550-record repeats, and integrates independent projectile class resolution, adaptive-disabled fine routing and save/load FIFO ownership. Unit/captain producers retain their player class; groups copy the first member's class. Engine matches captured route words/work and preserves launching player. Static-only line/point mappings are distinguished from observed SpiderAttack searches; full missile ability trajectories are outside this scheduling inventory.
- [x] **SCHED-03.2** [Payoff106](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#task-transitions-retire-every-local-scheduler-request): two complete40-sample public queued-head Stop/reissue, owner-change/reissue and deletion producers repeat16,748 ordered scheduler/search/boundary records. Actual bridge/mover/path bindings prove the mutated units were waiting. Every FIFO count/head/tail/survivor, actual charge, timestamp and next admission is verified; reclassified requests use the new row and the deleted path never admits again. Engine Stop previously canceled only fine work, leaving a member coarse head queued; unified O(1) local cancellation fixes the failing regression, with actual public-order/save continuation in both schemas. Original480 four-policy Stop cases cover policy selection. Admission168310 is head-only and contains no gameplay callback; public mutations happen between admissions, while callback mutation of group traversal remains SCHED-02.4. Frozen full repeats/source provenance and saved replayable Ghidra mappings accompany the engine change.
- [x] **SCHED-03.3** Cross the scheduler work-counter wrap; compare charged work and admission to an equivalent clean-counter run. [Payoff105](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#work-counter-wrap-preserves-unsigned-admission) executes original post-search ADD/CMP/timestamp instruction slices and complete admission in2560 synthetic cases across all64 buckets. Engine production charge/admission matches captured work, timestamps, FIFO and clean-counter admission. Native fine uses cumulative64; coarse uses search-local32. Stock admission/search bounds exclude a public work overflow; the synthetic boundary is not presented as a live trajectory. Fine save validation closes the discovered unreachable-counter hole with retail/responsive inclusive-bound round trips and rejection regressions; save109 layout stays unchanged. Owner-clock wrap remains01.2.
- [x] **SCHED-03.4** Explicitly split ordinary fine player-row ownership from03.1/03.2/04: partition work/FIFO across all16 unit-player classes, cancel ordinary Move while the old owner is published, unlink old requests before class changes and removals, and retain independent work/FIFOs/intervals through save/load. Compare public ownership-change motion/Stop words through complete stationary continuation. Other three policy pools, non-unit class15 producers and mutation during original active traversal remain the parent leaves. Evidence: [payoff40](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ordinary-fine-search-belongs-to-the-unit-player),365 exactly repeated public lifecycle records/17 arithmetic commits/two native Stops; normal-frame motion/final Stop and before/after saved continuations; all240 different-player changes,16-row removals/independent saves and actual route-consumer charging. Debug/release RoC/TFT each pass189,902 assertions/2,313 tests; production builds, repository suite,175 Python tests and fresh scheduler/live corpus checks pass. Save76 and saved Ghidra roles/types are synchronized.

### SCHED-04 — Contention

- [x] **SCHED-04.1** Two allied owners contend through96 independent public Move groups. [Payoff102](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#coarse-and-fine-contention-retain-independent-player-fifos): two complete retail repeats preserve25,902 ordered scheduler records;517 captured owner-window transactions match7,225 actual engine assertions for admission/work/FIFO/time/reset state. Missing coarse admission is integrated alongside real public96-unit normal-frame/save continuation. Coarse waits reach3 passes; fine waits17/14. Priority producer mapping remains03.1.
- [x] **SCHED-04.2** [Payoff102](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#coarse-and-fine-contention-retain-independent-player-fifos): three public order waves over300 samples preserve FIFO order through repeated exhausted group/fine budgets for both players. Eight coarse episodes per player and443/561 fine episodes reach admission;20 fine episodes per player retire by independent unlink. One player1 fine request is still queued at the30-second boundary with one observed owner pass of waiting; the captured suffix admits it. Frozen queue snapshots, strict repeat/mutation rejection and production continuation regressions establish this fixed-trace behavior, without claiming a universal starvation bound or closing03.2/03.3.

## MOVE — Stepping and callbacks

Evidence: [movement evidence][M]. Tools/artifacts: motion, speed, numeric.

MOVE-01.4 explicitly splits the ordinary authored/public speed producer port from
01.1. The remaining hero contribution, special ability/type limits, acceleration
and turn producers still belong to01.1. MOVE-01.5 explicitly adds the engine
low-cap transition discovered during the next public travel capture. It closes
zero-elapsed immediate vector clamping, with nonzero-elapsed owner-clock
production retained by NUM-02.3 and temporary-effect restoration by01.2.
MOVE-01.6 explicitly adds the missing flat-bonus engine query and saved
publication state; it does not close the original bonus writer or other effects.

### MOVE-01 — Movement parameters

- [ ] **MOVE-01.1** Trace authored speed, acceleration and turn/movement-angle data into a new mover; assert converted values and clamp order.
- [x] **MOVE-01.2** Apply then remove a temporary speed/turn modifier during travel; assert committed velocity and restoration. Payoff88: paired original Slow/Bloodlust applications and public removal selectors, exact immediate cap publication and restored speed; real applying-owner procedures reproduce590 native commits and4356 Save97 continuation commits across four frame sizes. Spell-cast admission/windup and other buff families remain existing ORDER-01.13/E2E scope. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#temporary-speed-modifiers-publish-through-their-applying-owners).
- [ ] **MOVE-01.3** Record group/request writes to those parameters and test each reachable overwrite order against the authored defaults.
- [x] **MOVE-01.4** Split ordinary nonhero public speed setter/current/default getters and authored limits from01.1: preserve integer umvs/umis/umas map fields, clamp profile bounds before current speed, retain explicit zero across save/load and ignore movement-disabled setters. Evidence: [authored speed limits reach Move](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-speed-limits-reach-move),1846 original/C clamp/gate cases, repeated120 public calls/26 publications/153 captured commits, actual public-order and saved-step regressions. Hero defaults, special caps/effect-stack ordering, immediate low-cap integration and clock cadence remain01.1/2/NUM-02.3.

- [x] **MOVE-01.5** Explicitly add immediate low-cap vector publication during public Move: reproduce the engine retaining old fast velocity, port verified zero-delta normalization without changing pose/facing, preserve higher-cap velocity and save/load subsequent motion. Evidence: [speed drops clamp existing velocity immediately](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#speed-drops-clamp-existing-velocity-immediately),756 complete original/C transitions and repeated public during-travel zero-elapsed clamp/128 captured commits. Original nonzero-elapsed integration is independently composed; engine owner clocks and temporary-effect restoration remain NUM-02.3/01.2.

- [x] **MOVE-01.6** Explicitly add the missing AIms engine contribution: aggregate the maximum nonnegative authored flat bonus across native/item owners, preserve rawcode aliases and item-use permission, distinguish public query from the bonus last published by a setter/new Move order, and save/reload retained-cap motion. Evidence: [flat bonuses retain their publication state](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#flat-bonuses-retain-their-publication-state),126 complete original/C compositions, repeated quiet and explicit-publication Boots scenes, actual public inventory/Move and eight-step save regression. Original bonus88 writer, broader temporary effects, mixed cohort notification and owner-clock timing remain01.1/2/3 and NUM-02.3.

### MOVE-02 — Stepping

- [x] **MOVE-02.1** Compare a long oblique trajectory with speed and heading changes at fixed ticks; assert old-velocity integration and exact positions. [Payoff84](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#timed-speed-changes-stationary-turns-and-boundary-restarts): two complete native journeys repeat763 commits/762 decisions and all timed public speed/retarget producers. Normal engine RunFrame matches every raw position/velocity/facing/clock word and4877 saved suffix commits; all324 public markers compare exactly after correcting default R2S software rounding. General timer/scalar inventories and other movement profiles retain their existing NUM/MOVE tasks.
- [x] **MOVE-02.2** Exercise stationary turn, Stop and restart at a cell boundary; assert facing, zero velocity and occupancy before/after each event. Same [Payoff84](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#timed-speed-changes-stationary-turns-and-boundary-restarts):24 literal committed event states and23 complete watched-cell chains retain active ordinary occupancy during zero-translation facing changes and both exact world640,608 resets. Eleven Save93 continuations span cap publication, retarget, stationary turn, Stop and restarts. No scene-dependent movement rule is introduced; full both-edition suites, fresh strict contracts and saved Ghidra annotations pass.

- [x] **MOVE-02.3** Integrate existing authored status/aura speed consumers into individual Move stepping and active selection-group caps. Evidence: [effective speed reaches movement](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#effective-speed-reaches-actual-movement); four actual Cripple/Bloodlust Move failures precede the shared consumer fix, then individual/group step lengths and expiry pass22 assertions. No field/version/wire change; retail effect-stack ordering and full clock parity remain open.

### MOVE-03 — Spatial and presentation callbacks

- [x] **MOVE-03.1** Cross a region boundary with nonzero elapsed time; assert enter/exit callback order relative to occupancy and support-height publication. Payoff85: complete repeated ground journeys,18 states/17 cell chains, original fine-cell registration controls and Move-owned publication; exact public world/support and primary callback clocks across5/10/25/50ms engine frames. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#region-callbacks-observe-committed-movement-and-retain-forced-changes).
- [x] **MOVE-03.2** Teleport or remove the mover from a region callback; assert no stale post-callback position/occupancy commit. Payoff85: teleport/new Move/queued leave and removal through actual native callbacks,629 literal commits and3418 Save94 suffix commits; no removed-owner commit, exact retained forced pose and same-clock event draining. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#region-callbacks-observe-committed-movement-and-retain-forced-changes).
- [ ] **MOVE-03.3** Travel over one bridge/water support transition with nonzero UI limits; assert support source, height and clamped presentation transform.

### MOVE-04 — Movement bypasses

- [x] **MOVE-04.1** Disable then enable pathing during travel; assert route/occupancy invalidation and the first resumed step. Payoff86: the original changes the fine query to0 while retaining category010000ca and the acquired hierarchy/fine leg. Separate coarse/adaptive masks and zero-query fine refinement now match773 complete commits and all13 original searches without direct-steering substitution. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#pathing-queries-and-scripted-pause-preserve-distinct-owners).
- [x] **MOVE-04.2** Pause/resume and force-displace a mover; assert clock, velocity and route retention or reset. Payoff86: original suspension head851973, synchronous pause getter, zero velocity/physical route release, fractional paused axis displacement and delayed point-head reactivation. Real RunFrame and eight Save95 states repeat6171 suffix commits across5/10/25/50ms frames; all310 public markers and literal boundary/occupancy states match. Other order families and nested suspension ownership remain existing ORDER tasks. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#pathing-queries-and-scripted-pause-preserve-distinct-owners).
- [x] **MOVE-04.3** Teleport and switch movement mode via public producers; assert grids/lanes and next request. Payoff87: Chaos ground/flight/ground plus two fractional SetUnitPosition cancellations, exact own rectangles/category/query, fine-only flight searches and restored ground hierarchy. Engine737 commits and6534 saved suffix commits agree across four frame sizes. Other morph/cast families remain ORDER-01.13 and cross-feature E2E controls; no new IDs. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#movement-modes-select-routing-policy-independently-of-spatial-membership).

## ORDER — Orders and reclamation

Evidence: [order evidence][M]. Tools/artifacts: order_tasks, arrival, lifetime.

### ORDER-01 — Arrival and failure dispatch

- [x] **ORDER-01.1** 24 generated point-order chains arrive and reclaim queues/pools; 288 internal tasks complete. Evidence: [queued arrival][arrival], O `queued_order_arrival_cases=24`; open fine grid and explicit group ticks.
- [ ] **ORDER-01.2** Enumerate remaining arrival/can't-path early exits and unit-state gates; add one full-dispatch witness per branch, including unit+280 bit40.
- [x] **ORDER-01.3** Payoff197: full public blocked Move plus genuine Shift successor; two read-only captures match67 synchronous recovery rows, four fine searches, next-head activation and final task/FIFO/ref cleanup, and all253 public markers agree with an unhooked control. Engine failing-first207-commit/four-save blocked lifetime clears stale retry/wait state; production completion stage preserves synchronous pending-order dispatch and following old-owner retirement. Existing numerical fixtures unchanged. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-recovery-unwinds-before-queued-successor-payoff197).
- [x] **ORDER-01.4** Trace retail `GetUnitCurrentOrder` and separate OpenRealm's ordinary point-Move current query from historical issued-event ID storage. Verify admission, queued Smart activation, replacement/rejection, Stop and natural arrival through public natives/server frames, including save/load and actual edict reuse. Evidence: [current point-order ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#current-point-order-ownership), registered2039d0 full native at42 frozen states plus18 invalid-backing controls, both cases repeated identically (124 executed calls); failing engine regression followed by Move-owned admission/current state and save57. Immutable callbacks are independently closed01.5. Non-point orders are explicitly01.6 and indexed by BASE-03.1; this does not certify those queries or full original JASS/Unit construction.
- [x] **ORDER-01.5** Preserve accepted issued-order IDs, points and targets in queued and suspended event contexts, independently of subsequent per-unit orders. Verify delayed Move/Smart/Stop, reentrant point replacement, both target event families, unread-event save/load and sleeping-callback save/load; exclude unrelated spell metadata through the retail event-type gates. Evidence: [immutable issued-order callbacks](issued-target-order-events.md#immutable-callback-ownership), failing public-native regression followed by engine fix, JASS snapshot7, persisted Ghidra getters/prototypes and full tests. Ordinary point active query state is separately01.4; complete original event producer/subscriber mutation graph remains ORDER-03/BASE-03.1.
- [x] **ORDER-01.6** Export the bounded current-command owner matrix and split the original non-point query acceptance into explicit domain leaves01.7..16. Link engine owners, known retail dispatch/interception roots and each remaining witness; persist the known Hold/Patrol/Smart/Attack Move/shared-dispatch names and Hold field/prototypes in Ghidra. Evidence: [owner inventory](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#remaining-command-owner-inventory),277 names/17 layouts/110 fields/44 prototypes with guarded refinement and negative controls. This inventory does not close the remaining domain leaves or BASE-03.1's complete reachable producer graph.
- [x] **ORDER-01.7** Verify public Hold Position's current head retires to0 while Hold behavior persists, including standing, actual automatic damage and replacement; add engine public-native/server-frame/save/queued-clear witnesses. Evidence: [Follow/Hold ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#current-follow-and-hold-ownership), two complete owned retail captures with identical320 timer/health markers, original Hold task/state instruction map and engine regression. No persistent851993 query is synthesized; full original class/producer construction remains BASE-03.1.
- [x] **ORDER-01.8** Integrate healthy allied-unit target Move/Smart Follow current IDs through actual activation, persistent standing/pursuit, replacement/rejection, Stop, queued activation/handoff, death, save/load and edict reuse. Evidence: [Follow/Hold ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#current-follow-and-hold-ownership), failing public-native regression followed by Move-owned S_IssueFollowOrder, real server frames and repeated public retail IDs851986/851971. Full target policy/visibility/route branches remain TARGET; synchronous RemoveUnit loss is independently01.15 and metadata/spells/interactions have their own leaves.
- [x] **ORDER-01.9** Trace and integrate public Patrol point admission and current head851991 across endpoint reversal, rejected/replacing orders, queued activation, Stop/death and save/reuse. Route selected-unit UI/Shift through the same Patrol owner; require actual approach/return travel in the repeated live witness. Evidence: [current Patrol ownership](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#current-patrol-ownership), native/UI regressions fail against the committed engine then pass45 checks; real server frames, save/reuse, repeated live approach/reversal and negative trace controls,18 layouts/115 fields/45 prototypes saved in Ghidra and122/122 fresh strict corpus outcomes. Automatic combat/resume and complete original endpoint/arrival policy are independently01.18.
- [x] **ORDER-01.10** Trace and integrate public Attack/Attack Move/Attack Ground and target Attack Once ownership through approach, committed attack/swing, automatic combat, completion/rejection/replacement, FIFO handoff, death and save/reuse. Payoffs173..175 integrate independent public heads, target-to-point snapshots, saved swing requests and deferred target-loss/one-shot retirement. Ordinary Ground holds without damage; both weapon slots follow the complete original selector. Failing-first actual JASS/frame/queue/save/death/reuse regressions,10 complete observed captures/four controls/15 ownership claims and5,184 original slot witnesses pass. Exact approach/visibility/scalar caller composition stays in TARGET/NUM; this ownership closure does not claim complete combat numerics. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#attack-once-and-ordinary-attack-ground-ownership-payoff175).
- [x] **ORDER-01.11** Trace and integrate Repair current-head admission/approach/work/completion/interruption, Smart repair identity and auto-repair/internal approaches, pending activation, death and save/reuse through s_repair.c and the concrete retail owner. Preserve publisher/callback identity separately. Payoff122: two repeated four-race native matrices match1,316 complete records/566 motion observations each; two external native Shift witnesses activate all four race heads after Move and naturally complete. Concrete flat registry owners reject before FIFO mutation, retain working-target interception and deferred target loss, guard reused target slots, and round-trip active/pending/removed-target state through Save116. Ghidra saves16 functions,12 fields and five explicit ABIs. Repair-rate/full approach numerics and construction race strategies retain their broader existing scopes. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#repair-families-own-admission-work-and-pending-activation).
- [ ] **ORDER-01.12** Trace and integrate Harvest/return-resource current ownership across each race/resource path, Smart admission, mine/cargo entry, internal approaches, completion/interruption, queued activation, death and save/reuse. Inventory early-return publisher paths explicitly; construction is separately01.16.
- [ ] **ORDER-01.13** Trace and integrate ability current-head ownership through target/point approaches, execution, channels, instant actions, completion/inverse/interruption, rejection, queued policy, death and save/reuse. Concrete abilities own these transitions; internal order_move must not invent public Move identity. Split by bounded cast family as necessary.
- [x] **ORDER-01.14** Trace metadata/toggle interception and integrate preservation/replacement of an existing active user head through concrete owning abilities. Payoff119: Defend and runtime ARal share original virtual22c's reject body; accepted normal native admission replaces Move and retires the instantaneous head, while repeated/disabled/unresearched/invalid requests preserve busy Move. Three complete two-repeat scenes verify210 public records and99 motion commits; concrete ability owners, queue/save controls and15 saved continuations agree. Other cast families and Shift/UI entry timing retain existing ORDER-01.13/BASE scope. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#modal-orders-validate-before-replacing-active-movement).
- [x] **ORDER-01.15** Match retail's synchronous healthy active Follow head retirement when public RemoveUnit removes its target, while retaining OpenRealm's deferred edict/event lifetime. Verify both Move/Smart IDs, pending point activation, rejection of queued removed targets, unrelated/repeated removal and already-replaced point orders; prove next-frame cleanup and natural queued arrival. Evidence: [synchronous Follow loss](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#current-follow-and-hold-ownership), isolated failing engine regression followed by Move-owned notification/queued handoff,132 passing checks, repeated public retail tick130 current0 and122/122 strict corpus outcomes. Combat-parent/direct-free/reentrant-generation/save composition is split into01.17; runtime/lifetime producers remain BASE-03.1/TARGET.
- [ ] **ORDER-01.16** Trace and integrate Build current ownership through each construction race strategy, accepted/queued placement, approach/work, interruption/cancel/refund policy, rejected replacement, death and save/reuse. Resolve the actual public command from the construction owner instead of generic Move or publisher history; split the race matrix into bounded leaves if necessary.

- [x] **ORDER-01.17** Extend01.15 target loss through temporary automatic-combat ownership, direct free/death, callback reentrant removal, generation-safe target/subject reuse and save before deferred drain. Payoff123: seven-case complete retail repeats match1,455 public records each; actual RemoveUnit virtual84/6882e0/688300/651010 and death caller stacks prove loss publication. Move ignores automatic acquisition, Smart retains combat until enemy loss, healthy parents resume and nested replacement survives unwind. Seven engine regressions reproduce stale reuse/acquisition/ownership/save failures, then preserve pending activation, actual callback/frame cleanup and Save117. Empty physical owners drop borrowed targets in constant time. Full combat trajectory/timing remains01.10. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#follow-target-loss-preserves-temporary-combat-ownership).

- [x] **ORDER-01.18** Compose point Patrol automatic acquisition/damage/enemy loss and same-leg resume while retaining public851991; preserve rejection/replacement/death and saved combat/rotated FIFO. Payoff176 implements issued-point expansion threshold, originald0175 return append and5fcc70 queued rotation with activation-time origin. Pending Move runs at leg end; full user FIFO keeps its reserved return; unqueued reversals allocate nothing. Failing-first actual native/frame/full-FIFO/save regressions,4 complete observed captures/one control and32 complete native classifier calls pass. Exact route timing, unit-target Patrol, disabled Move and new retail UI save captures are outside this point ownership composition; no handoff-proposed IDs added. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#patrol-leg-completion-admits-queued-successors-payoff176).

### ORDER-02 — User/internal queues

- [x] **ORDER-02.1** Four two-order FIFO cases pass identity, successor timing, callback and final recovery assertions. Evidence: [FIFO][fifo], O `fifo_two_order_cases=4`; controlled command inputs.
- [ ] **ORDER-02.2** Map user Shift-queue versus internal task ownership and remaining queue control bits to producer/caller contracts.
- [x] **ORDER-02.3** Payoff263: empty FIFO, removed Attack fallback, failed Repair successor, pending cancellation and live target activation have two read-only original runs and an unhooked control each. All 543 public markers agree; 38 admissions/32 activations retain exact head/tail/count, nested same-tick successor dispatch and deferred canonical release/reference decrements. Engine moves generic issued notifications from append to activation, preserves lost-target point execution, callback replacement/Stop/removal and saved sparse queues. 691 saved Ghidra instructions and target-event ABI are pinned; complete control-bit producer inventory remains ORDER-02.2. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#generic-queued-orders-publish-at-activation-including-failed-successors-payoff263).

### ORDER-03 — Callback mutation

- [x] **ORDER-03.1** Insert/remove a subscription while dispatching to multiple subscribers; assert delivery order, iterator and reference counts. Payoff177 integrates synchronous indexed issued-order families, saved append ranks/cutoffs, immediate destroy suppression/counters and ordered primary-clock cleanup. Seventeen failing-first native/registration/save/scaling regressions pass in Classic/TFT; fresh 627 original cases verify complete native delivery/reference/pool semantics, and five complete archived Frida logs retain controls/repeat. Stable engine registry slots replace native pool pointers; nested Stop/death/removal remain ORDER-03.2. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#synchronous-issued-order-subscribers-and-deferred-trigger-cleanup-payoff177).
- [x] **ORDER-03.2** Destroy an order or unit from a subscriber, then perform nested dispatch; assert depth/unwind and payload lifetime with no stale callback. Payoff178 integrates transient Stop completion, synchronous player/unit death with producer-specific presence sampling, deferred removal with accepted suspended point heads, and ability-owned retirement/detach notifications. Eight failing-first native regressions and focused Classic/TFT movement/save/queue suites pass, alongside fresh 411 original cases, eleven full prepared Frida captures and three fresh correction captures; incomplete runs remain explicitly rejected. Ghidra packet/ABIs and mapper saved. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#nested-orders-retain-their-packet-and-removal-suspends-execution-payoff178).

### ORDER-04 — Reference reclamation

- [x] **ORDER-04.1** Eight last-reference release cycles and six factory reuses pass. Evidence: [payload reclamation][reclamation]; preallocated pools and supplied registration, no populated relations/negative domain.
- [ ] **ORDER-04.2** Construct and release an object with populated relations/children through the real factory; assert child/reference cleanup and free-list recovery.
- [ ] **ORDER-04.3** Exercise bridge guard failure, stale identity and both handle domains; assert rejection and reference balance.
- [x] **ORDER-04.4** Grow an empty factory/pool through its allocator boundary; assert first construction and final payload/wrapper release. [Payoff192](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#cold-point-factories-and-empty-queue-storage-payoff192): cold original COrderPoint(58/1), CTaskPoint(50/64) and wrapper(bc/512) storage grows through513 simultaneous pairs per class,2052 final clock releases and allocation-free exact LIFO reuse. Supplied class/registry bindings are explicit. Two public129-unit Move bursts retain258 complete task lifetimes,270 markers and exact repeat/control streams. Engine reclaims empty queue buckets after cancellation/final dispatch; failing-first129-unit/stale-target/replacement tests and wrapped/empty save round-trips pass both schemas.

### ORDER-05 — Deferred requests

- [x] **ORDER-05.1** Populate the deferred heap with different/equal deadlines; assert pop/tie order, cancellation and wrapper reuse. Payoff179 integrates indexed unit releases with minimum-delay deadlines, unsigned serial keys, arbitrary cancellation, incarnation/reuse checks and popped-clock callback chaining in the primary drain. Twelve production regressions, focused Classic/TFT suites, fresh 432 original cases and two full repeated/control Frida captures pass; saved Ghidra layouts/eleven ABIs and mapper retain the contract. Native pool addresses are not engine identities; repeating listeners and clock persistence remain05.2/03. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#unit-releases-join-the-primary-deadline-heap-payoff179).
- [x] **ORDER-05.2** Schedule a repeating request and a callback that schedules/cancels another; assert invocation order and final heap/refcount state. Payoff180 integrates registration-phased range polling, stable repeat serials, callback-created deadlines and three-stage trigger/registration/listener releases. Indexed requests and linear stamped occupants preserve predicted circle tests, Y/X traversal, reverse enters and swap-last reconciliation; production Classic/TFT regressions include dense4096 removal and cold saves. Fresh432 original cases and complete repeated/control Frida archives pass; saved Ghidra/mapper retain ten ABIs and the query prefix. Unobservable private cancelled nodes are eagerly removed; clock-wide persistence remains05.3. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#range-listeners-poll-ordered-occupants-at-request-deadlines-payoff180).
- [x] **ORDER-05.3** Restore or switch the request clock with pending deadlines; assert which callbacks fire and when without rebasing deadlines by assumption. Payoff181 saves absolute unit-release keys and live JASS identities, reconstructs cold heaps, discards outgoing unsaved requests, settles old primary owners through software0.2s, and retains first-timer callback clocks. Production Classic/TFT regressions retain exact live wrap/load listener words, release order and rebased saves; fresh432 original cases and complete prepared wrap/UI-load controls pass. Saved Ghidra/mapper retain nine ABIs and clock/wrapper fields. Native presentation/sign-switch and pause are labelled forced-state helper evidence; no unobserved public producer is invented. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#pending-request-clocks-survive-wrap-and-load-payoff181).

### ORDER-06 — Cancellation and interruption

- [x] **ORDER-06.1** Three mode-1 replacements at tick3 admit only the replacement and recover all three orders. Evidence: [replacement][interrupt], O `replacement_arrival_cases=3`; other phases excluded.
- [x] **ORDER-06.2** Three mode-0 interrupts reach the temporary destination, resume the original and run its successor. Evidence: [interrupt/resume][interrupt], O `prepend_complete_cases=3`; explicit group scheduling.
- [x] **ORDER-06.3** Run Stop/replacement while waiting, searching and turning; assert surviving queue, active flags and reclaimed allocations at each phase. [Payoff208](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stop-cancels-physical-ownership-independently-of-animation-payoff208): repeated public turning and96-unit pending/travel scenes preserve30/492 physical Stop brackets,326 visual visits,737 completed searches and survivor FIFO/accounting. Stop/Hold now retire idle bridge-owned angular work before stand. Actual engine callback samples and fine/coarse/active/angular replacement/save/reclamation tests pass both schemas; public commands occur between bounded synchronous searches, not inside a forced callback. Private stale-row layout remains GROUP-04.6.
- [x] **ORDER-06.4** Run interruption during group completion and deferred release; assert no duplicate arrival/release and correct resumed order. [Payoff209](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#interruption-keeps-successor-ownership-through-completion-and-release-payoff209): two complete public spell-arrival/removal scenes match2768 rows and152 observer-free markers. Suspended Stop/Hold/entity/point heads do not dispatch; completion and first deferred cleanup replace the surviving caster in turn. Two finishes,196 unique destructions and next-counter successor ownership are checked. Actual engine CHANNEL-before-commit, suspension, final Move, old-owner reclamation and Save150 regressions pass both editions. Full spell lifecycle, private rows and arbitrary FIFO reentrancy remain separate scopes.
- [x] **ORDER-06.5** [Payoff107](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mover-retirement-cancels-tasks-before-releasing-storage): two complete45-sample public pending/traveling KillUnit/RemoveUnit producers repeat22,137 ordered scheduler/search/task/lifetime observations. Orders, velocity, group identity, route state and local FIFO retire at public return; canonical corpse path storage survives until removal, while detached ordinary group/path storage retires at the next owner visit. Engine removal now cancels commands, physical movement and the old scheduled callback synchronously; routes invalidate without freeing local storage, empty ordinary groups retain the owner boundary and save/load. Public independent/cohort orders cover fine/member-coarse pending and active movement, queued successors, survivor queues, deferred/corpse storage and saved retirement (530 assertions per schema). Frozen repeat/source and negative evidence checks, regression-first failures, updated mapping/readback and saved Ghidra accompany the change. Full private member-layout replacement and callback traversal remain GROUP-04.6/SCHED-02.4.
- [x] **ORDER-06.6** Exercise one relevant ability transition during movement; assert command preservation/cancellation and routing inverse. Payoff87: actual Chaos retains public Move through deferred type commit and ten-ms physical-task reissue, switches ground/flight routing and returns through the inverse; separate teleports cancel the head before placement. Saved pending transitions reproduce every subsequent native commit. Additional engine producer inventory is documented beside the witness; broader morph/cast lifetimes remain existing ORDER-01.13/E2E tasks without new IDs. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#movement-modes-select-routing-policy-independently-of-spatial-membership).

## GROUP — Shared movement groups

Evidence: [group evidence][M]. Tools/artifacts: motion.

### GROUP-01 — Group producers

- [x] **GROUP-01.1** [Payoff239](retail-pathfinding-queued-cohorts.md#player-singleton-publication-clears-shared-history-payoff239): selected ordinary/Alt and singleton, independent JASS and24/25-member Captain producer inventory records sharing, twelve-member physical limits and distinct flags/policies. Two new singleton and two pair-to-singleton retail repeats expose unconditional history clearing before admission. Engine now clears player-only unassociated request history; failing-first immediate/Shift/Alt/independent/save tests and unchanged producer journeys pass. Wider canonical owner behavior remains GROUP-04.6.
- [ ] **GROUP-01.2** Trigger join/leave/merge/split through those producers; assert membership and route ownership after each transition.

- [x] **GROUP-01.3** Explicitly split public JASS point-order admission from01.1: map name/ById/Loc/ByIdLoc to one native leaf, verify twelve-member insertion-order admission and all-candidate attach before order validation, and implement the bounded snapshot plus missing numeric/Loc engine dispatch. Evidence: [payoff37](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-group-point-orders-admit-twelve-members), two complete scene46 admission captures, four shared original requests per capture/48 admitted/eight excluded members; engine regression reproduces the over-limit failure then passes allfour forms and invalid adapters. Ghidra retains nine producer/callback/snapshot roles and the44-byte request context. Persistent physical shared groups and complete trajectories remain04.6; selected/independent JASS/AI distinctions and flags remain01.1. Motion observer cap is explicit and certifies no whole trajectory.

### GROUP-02 — Fresh group movement

- [x] **GROUP-02.1** 144 complete cached-route group ticks and 156 membership prepasses are covered. Evidence: [cached group ticks][cached-groups]; fresh wall-pair search is covered separately by GROUP-02.3; additional failed-route policy remains open.
- [x] **GROUP-02.2** Two originally admitted units join one original request; fresh shared/member routes run through owner updates and natural tick7 arrival. Evidence: [fresh shared pair](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#fresh-shared-pair-through-owner-arrival), frozen `retail-shared-pair-1.27.json`, report `group-02.2-frozen-shared-pair.json`; both decisions precede both commits, all intermediate words repeat exactly, all orders/groups/paths reclaim. Public selected/JASS/AI callers remain GROUP-01.1.
- [x] **GROUP-02.3** Original three-cell terrain wall and Footman mask-producing prefix give opposing owned routes under one shared group, tick19/25 arrivals and complete recovery. Evidence: [wall pair and reversal](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#shared-pair-with-terrain-obstruction-and-reversal), report `group-02.3-wall-ground-frozen.json`, four frozen pair fixtures;46 owner commits match C, maskless/open/reversal controls retain all raw differences. Failed routes, runtime edits and full class notification remain separate exclusions.

### GROUP-03 — Shared parameters

- [x] **GROUP-03.1** Shared-cap ownership/publication and group radius lifecycles have original-code coverage. Evidence: [shared parameters][shared-groups]; remaining flag/AI producers and target-speed adjustment are not closed.
- [ ] **GROUP-03.2** Trace group bit800 and speed-cap exemption producers; exercise target-speed adjustment with both exempt and capped members. Payoff150 integrates target-speed matching with exact fine arithmetic, strict sampled-distance guards and saved hidden episodes; Payoff151 integrates pre-transform hit/acquisition exemptions, exact saved primary deadlines and cap/classification/regroup consumers; ally alerts, remaining producers/guards and public target-speed domains remain open. See [group speed](retail-pathfinding-group-speed.md). Payoff152 integrates ordered ordinary ally-help queries, authored radius plus candidate collision, directional permissions and saved source suppression; AI enrollment/propagation, remaining acquisition/guards and public target-speed domains remain open. See [ordered ally help](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ordered-ally-help-reaches-moving-peers-payoff152). Payoff153 integrates saved configured Town AI enrollment independently of script startup, genuine owner transfer, neutral12/15 radius/cooldown distinction and AI self alerts; repeated/control evidence and actual creation/transfer/save regressions pass. Propagation, wider AI-record/ability lifetimes and remaining guards/producers stay open. See [AI help policy](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#town-ai-enrollment-selects-the-help-policy-payoff153). Payoff199 integrates the remaining49d130 swing producer for explicit target/point weapons, with repeated/control retail evidence and production windup/replacement/save tests;49e130 guards and broader captain domains remain open. Payoff260 integrates the6991a2 owner-change availability broadcast after retained-target subscribers, using ordered indexed nearby acquisition, committed-range admission and the existing saved exemption clock. Two original repeats/control and actual engine regressions pass. Full49d680 replacement ranking, remaining guards/producers and broader domains remain open. See [target availability](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#target-availability-reaches-nearby-attack-subscribers-payoff260). Payoff262 fixes the explicit Attack/AttackOnce4000 suppression gate with accepted-owner state, pending/rejected order isolation and saved ownership; full ranking remains open. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#explicit-attack-owns-availability-suppression-payoff262).
- [x] **GROUP-03.3** Grow the shared auxiliary pool, change the largest member radius, then remove it; assert publication and allocation recovery. [Payoff189](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-parameter-growth-and-indexed-ownership-payoff189) executes original129 factories across three64-object blocks, exact two-group radius mutation/departure and allocation-free reuse. Engine derived indexing replaces repeated owner scans with expected constant lookup while preserving logical identities, ordered publication and next-owner reclamation; public Captain growth/save/Stop/reuse and existing raw journeys pass. Cold index restore and duplicate/binding rejection retain save146; broader Captain producers remain their own tasks.
- [ ] **GROUP-03.4** Run Captain AI attach/detach during movement; assert its shared-cap and delay ownership/inverse. Stationary authored-home recruit admission is split into03.4.1; CaptainGoHome, live shared attachment, virtual moving captain and follower task handoffs remain required here.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.1** Retain authored captain home/roster/goal through InitAssault, formation flag and AddAssault admission; complete stationary singleton home travel through the private range callback and point handoff. [Payoff56](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stationary-captain-range-callback-and-zero-radius-occupancy) matches complete178/250 native commits from two source positions and2225 saved suffix commits, including exact2s/3s deadlines, post-owner callback ordering, zero-radius category2 occupancy, retry/forced arrival, Stop/replacement/removal, captain recreation and bot-free restore. Saved Ghidra annotations and strict repeated native/blocker evidence persist. Default AI town homes, moving captains, larger shared batches and wider AI lifetime remain03.4/FOOT-01.3.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.2** Compose the stationary two-ground-recruit home journey from the verified actor/timer. [Payoff57](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stationary-captain-pair-private-followers-to-shared-arrival) matches369 complete native commits and2003 saved suffix commits; both callbacks gate one two-pass shared point request,152 shared7c/pathb4 footprint updates retain the final survivor, and initial followers remain independent. Save84, Stop/replacement/removal, captain recreation, bot-free restoration and invalid membership state are covered. Ghidra591 roles preserve recruitment/roster order and virtual target-region semantics. Native pair path94/98 never consume a retry; that acceptance is explicitly split into03.4.3. Larger mixed-radius rosters, live attach/detach and moving captain lifetimes remain03.4/FOOT-01.3.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.3** Extend the stationary shared captain pair to unequal mover radii and a blocked formation endpoint that naturally consumes a retry; compare all native commits, shared7c/pathb4 changes and saved continuations before/after admission and retry. Evidence: [mixed captain pairs and blocked home retries](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-captain-pairs-and-blocked-home-retries), two uninterrupted repeats per scene; mixed185+184 commits,152 shared updates including live31/cached32 survivor,2003 saved commits; blocked254+270 commits,237 shared updates, fourteen real retries/two forced arrivals,2685 saved commits. Engine now admits the virtual actor beside blocked home, uses its actual range center and temporarily excludes actor rectangles during group/member coarse admission. Full normal-frame/save/cancellation/bot-free journeys match. Larger12+1 batches, live attach/detach and general dynamic coarse publication remain03.4/FOOT-01.3/MAP-03.3.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.4** Retain native owned-pool insertion order across RemoveUnit/edict reuse, true owner transfer and same-owner no-op; compose partial AddAssault and captain roster prepend through complete journeys. Evidence: [owned-pool ordering](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#captain-owned-pool-order-survives-transfer-and-reused-slots), two complete repeats each for transfer, no-op, delayed lower-slot reuse and AddAssault(1)→(2);908 physical commits and4344 saved suffixes. Engine lifecycle insertion replaces reverse-edict scanning; Save85 retains both64-bit fields and rejects invalid order. Saved Ghidra roles/layouts preserve698ce0→9b9230→9c3660 head insertion and9c32d0 traversal. Larger batches, live membership/continued recruitment after restore and moving captains remain03.4/FOOT-01.3.

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.5** Extend stationary captain admission to three ground recruits, compose all-entered shared point travel through shrinking 3→2→1 membership and retained retry budget; compare complete motion and saved continuations. Evidence: [three-member shared journey](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stationary-captain-three-member-shared-journey), two complete native repeats; 608 physical commits and 2,352 exact saved suffix commits. The reproduced two-member fallback diverges at commit2/1,020ms; Move admission and Save85 validation now support three, with unchanged numerical kernels. Saved Ghidra comments retain the third-callback gate and single-draw retry lifetime. Full debug/release suites, 342 Python checks and 36 fresh contracts pass. Twelve-plus-one batching remains03.4.6; live attach/detach and moving captain policy remain03.4/FOOT-01.3.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6** Extend stationary captain admission across the native twelve-member batch boundary with thirteen recruits; retain 12+1 shared parameter ownership, complete motion, natural cleanup and saved continuations. [Payoff200 audit](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#audited-thirteen-member-captain-contract-payoff200) closes the parent after all children: complete homogeneous/mixed engine trajectories, two mutable shared generations, largest/final binding cancellation, exact reference retirement and saved continuations remain matched to the unchanged repeated retail fixtures. Wider moving Captain/roster policies remain03.4/03.4.7.3.

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.1** Compose the homogeneous thirteen-Footman stationary home scene through actual W3E-supported birth placement, private followers, 12+1 shared batches, all3,647 physical commits, cleanup and saved continuations. [Complete engine journey](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#stationary-captain-thirteen-member-batch-boundary): two complete retail repeats, all57 retry/PRNG transitions and15,768 exact saved suffix commits. Move batches13 into12+1 and resets replaced-path search admission; Save85 validates retained13-member references. Saved Ghidra notes retain batch cursors, shared wrapper and activation timestamps. Mixed-radius shared ownership remains03.4.6.2.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2** Put the largest mover in the thirteenth/singleton batch and prove the shared parameter owner publishes that maximum into both physical groups through member completion, cancellation and saved continuations. [Payoff200 audit](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#audited-thirteen-member-captain-contract-payoff200) joins completed Payoffs63/65/66/67/120/189/190/193: exact live/cached maxima, two generations, complete movement, Stop/removal/retarget, ordered reclamation and bot-free saves. All eight child tasks are closed; no numerical expectation or task scope is widened.

Private captain range (GROUP-03.4.6.2.1) is split into a verified ground recruit
increment and the remaining broader producer policies:

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.1.1** Recover and port ordinary ground recruits' authored private captain approach range independently of collision radius. [Payoff62](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#private-captain-approach-range-is-independent-of-collision) observes original9d86f0/4985c0 and70/600/300 runtime constants in two full mixed13 repeats. Footman maximum90 yields124 authored world units, then physical31/63 gives4.84375/5.84375 fine cells. Engine3471 exact pre-batch/activation commits and17368 saved suffix commits replace the incorrect five-radius shortcut; map-local weapon overrides preserve the actual input. Full mixed engine parity remains open at9.03s.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.1.2** Verify the private captain range's wider public producers: no attack class versus disabled weapons, Hero minimum, BTLF and native unit5c.40000000, siege-roster6c.20 bonus, attack-slot suppression and target-adjusted range. Assert creation/replacement and retained physical range across weapon changes and saves. [Payoff193](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#captain-range-producers-and-retained-point-requests-payoff193) completes the range contract integrated by Payoffs121/154–158: actual outer departure/return/second-departure cycles reacquire prevention, BTLF, removed Attack and research inputs while preserving old physical ranges across eight saves. Repeated Captain points now retain existing Move-to-Captain identity and captured range;39 failing-first assertions become green. Two public retail repeats preserve15 heads and770 control-identical markers through Long Rifles and repeated points. Original retained-target setter has no code/data references; no public producer is invented. Engine persistence is tested; no new retail save/load capture or complete new trajectory claim. Public Attack re-add and broader combat/transport/Town lifecycle remain separately documented/open.

Shared owner publication (GROUP-03.4.6.2.2) is split into the first engine phase
and the wider mixed cancellation/reclamation control:

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.1** Port prior speed publication/reset, global live radius accumulation before physical routing, cached footprint separation and stable owner references for the mixed13 handoff and largest-member completion. [Payoff63](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#shared-captain-parameters-across-unequal-physical-batches):4560 exact commits through12000ms,127 footprint observations and9618 Save86 suffix commits. Complete native repeats retain353 footprints and325 publications across two distinct generations. Captain admission now composes bounded old-source recovery; saved classification cooldown preserves the existing blocked pair. Full mixed recovery/reentry remains03.4.6.2.3.
**GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.2 — Mixed13 cancellation and reference lifetime.** Largest-member Stop and explicit last-binding retirement have separate public witnesses.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.2.1** Verify largest-recruit public Stop before/after shared admission, retained logical roster, surviving live maximum versus cached footprint, exact surviving references, generation reuse and saved continuation. Complete repeated early/late native captures authenticate retry+a4 as a fine-target record pointer. Engine matches5458/5593 complete commits,353/400 footprints and11764/12572 saved suffix commits. Full debug/release/repository suites,393 Python checks,42 fresh contracts and saved Ghidra readback pass. See [payoff66](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#largest-captain-recruit-stop-before-and-after-shared-admission).
**GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.2.2 — Final-binding cancellation.** Public Stop and RemoveUnit/retarget with fresh parameter reuse need separate composed witnesses.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.2.2.1** Explicitly Stop all13 bound physical movers, retain empty groups until the next physical owner visit, collect their zero-reference shared owner on the following prepass, and reproduce saved pending/zero/collected states. Complete repeated native journeys match3549 commits/12 footprints. Second public StartCampaignAI reloads sources without replaying main; engine Save88 retains its creation gate. See [payoff67](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#final-captain-binding-stop-and-repeated-ai-initialization). Full debug/release/repository suites,404 Python checks,43 fresh contracts and saved Ghidra readback pass.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.2.2.2.2** Compose final-binding RemoveUnit/retarget controls and fresh parameter reuse with a new generation after explicit cancellation. [Payoff120](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#final-captain-binding-cancellation-withdrawal-and-refill): three complete two-repeat public scenes;14,981 exact engine commits,615 footprints, signed deferred13→0 withdrawal, retained Stop/retarget rosters and four fresh shared generations. Physical bindings retire before reuse; fifteen saves include shared-target continuation and partial-removal count validation. Existing captain refill avoids entry replay and unverified captain-recreation assumptions.

**GROUP-03.4.7 — Moving captain policies.** Explicitly split initial public native travel, its private retry continuation and wider home/retreat admission from03.4's moving-captain requirement.

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.7.1** Implement public CaptainGoHome through the AI player's attack captain, retain occupied home requests, virtual minimum roster speed/turn/window,500-versus200 request policy, shared12+1 batching, near-home no-op and idle-member private approach. [Payoff68](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-captaingohome-and-moving-virtual-captain) compares both uncapped repeats through23.8s:6251 exact engine commits including193 virtual,398 footprints and11228 exact saved suffix commits. Saved Ghidra functions, fields, constants and explicit calling conventions retain the evidence. This closes initial travel only.
**GROUP-03.4.7.2 — Moving captain retry continuation.** Split accepted destination/wait reset from one-point refill and subsequent complete travel.

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.7.2.1** Reset both member search buffers, retry and pending delay before advancing a newly accepted shifted-cell destination. [Payoff69](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#changed-captain-destination-resets-pending-waits) authenticates native counter1821's20→0 delay reset and three-point refill; the reproduced engine retained delay20 and its old partial route. Public GoHome now matches7419 commits including306 virtual,624 footprints and10606 exact saved suffix commits through27.2s. Saved Ghidra ABIs/comments retain168b80→168740→1687e0 and the native caller ordering. Timestamp producer domains and later refills remain open.
**GROUP-03.4.7.2.2 — Partial refill and later moving travel.** Split the ordinary engine consumer from the longer observation/journey domain.

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.7.2.2.1** Preserve exact source in one-point exhausted fine reconstruction, consume the retained intermediate coarse waypoint without reducing retry, and stop translation for native status2 independently of heading error. [Payoff70](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#partial-fine-refill-and-stopped-coarse-handoff) authenticates counter1933's701/700 search/source point/adaptive7→2/retry6 and counter1996's2→0 explicit stop. Public GoHome matches7933 motion commits,327 virtual commits,812 shared footprints and7310 saved suffix commits through30s. Both earlier references, fresh strict capture checks and saved Ghidra consumer comments remain exact.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.7.2.2.2** Extend Frida group/footprint observation beyond the authored30-second marker and compose the full later private retry translation with actual engine/save continuations. [Payoff89](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#extended-captain-travel-ends-in-a-retained-visible-follow-owner) repeats10,986 commits/865 shared footprints and exact group states through120 seconds, with27,703 saved suffix commits and stable ownership at5/10/25/50ms. Corrected acceptance premise: natural task reclamation is not expected under these unchanged inputs. Original16c390 retains the arrived private Follow owner while group bit1 is set and its target remains visible; two captures and the engine preserve that standing task without inventing cleanup. Target visibility loss and unrelated subsequent orders remain TARGET/ORDER. The primary-clock verifier now consumes the original scalar deadline rather than assuming six steps forever; production already uses that deadline. Source/map pins, O0/O2, fresh strict corpus, both full suites and saved Ghidra gate/ABI evidence pass.
- [ ] **GROUP-03.4.7.3** Compose autonomous occupied SetCaptainHome, empty/larger roster defaults, retreat and other public captain goal policies with moving actor/physical roster lifetimes. Near-home and explicit GoHome initial travel do not establish these producers; preserve diagnostics and add actual public-frame/save regressions for each independently recovered policy. Payoff159 integrates non-combat home/removal decisions, separate retreat bits, CaptainAttack/goal dispatch, speed defaults and saved periodic phase; full composed motion/combat and retail-save evidence remain open. See [Captain policy](retail-pathfinding-captain-policy.md). Payoff160 adds the ordinary retained-point speed multiplier and exact range-entry refresh with repeated public controls and engine save/inverse regressions; wider target/count/trajectory compositions remain open. Payoff161 removes the arbitrary thirteen-member engine limit with complete24/25 retail repeats/control, retained twelve-row batches, constant-time ordinary quorum counts and O(N log N) save duplicate validation. Failing-first actual large-roster admission/cold-save/removal/replacement regressions pass; full target/combat/special-counter and default-home compositions remain open. See [larger Captain rosters](retail-pathfinding-captain-storage.md#larger-rosters-and-constant-time-quorum-payoff161).

Mixed recovery and reentry (GROUP-03.4.6.2.3) require two separate producers:

- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.3.1** Port the observed captain range-departure callback into a fresh private approach at12.03s: retain actor identity, attack-derived approach range, exact deadline, old-velocity stop/recovery and new physical creation order. [Payoff64](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#captain-range-departure-into-a-private-approach):4867 exact movement commits before15000ms and7917 saved suffix commits. Two complete new captures authenticate34 native inner/outer counter changes and the12-second c8 departure. Save86 validates inactive shared followers and preserves a retired actor through reference transfer. Full logical counters after physical completion and the second shared gate are03.4.6.2.3.2. The broader deferred-member-removal experiment remains excluded after control regressions.
- [x] **GROUP-03.4.6.2.3.2** Retain logical roster membership and exact inner/outer c4/c8 state independently of completed physical tasks, then compose the later all-entered callback and second shared owner generation through the complete stationary alive5462-commit mixed13 journey. Nine exact native deadline masks/counts,353 footprints and11132 continuation commits across eight Save87 checkpoints agree. New task activation clears stale partial-route flags/counts/indices. Second publication at owner1558 restores63/32; live maximum falls31/32 at1561 while cached footprint stays63/32. Saved Ghidra request fields/function and activation/membership annotations retain the evidence. Dynamic roster/moving captain and mixed cancellation remain separate leaves. Evidence: [payoff65](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#logical-captain-roster-survives-physical-completion).


### GROUP-04 — Membership mutation

- [x] **GROUP-04.1** Cancel/detach a member during movement callbacks; verify reverse callback iteration and subsequent identity/ownership re-resolution, swap-removal order and every surviving row word. Preserve the original producers and distinguish controlled callback-boundary requests from a complete gameplay callback graph. Evidence: [callback-timed mutations](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#callback-timed-membership-mutation), frozen `retail-callback-mutations-1.27.json`,68 cases and two fresh strict corpus repeats. Handle reuse, full gameplay notification graph and survivor refresh/arrival remain open.
- [x] **GROUP-04.2** Complete the last member and run an all-invalid prepass; assert empty-group teardown, owner unlink and retained mover-owned state. Evidence: [callback completion and empty teardown](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#callback-completion-surviving-cohort-and-empty-teardown), open/wall frozen completion fixtures. The last invalid row is pruned, actual group virtual10 runs at count0, group/path pools return and owner unlinks; individual mover/path identities remain owned.
- [x] **GROUP-04.3** After GROUP-04.1, reclaim and reuse a member's handle through original producers during a callback; prove generation rejection, later iteration and registry/pool accounting. A pre-invalidated slot does not satisfy callback-timed reuse. Evidence: [callback-timed handle reuse](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#callback-timed-handle-reclamation-and-reuse), frozen open/wall reuse fixtures, four trigger/victim combinations each repeated twice, actual destructor/factory/activation, same-address/slot new generation and exact survivor row. Both registry aliases are supplied from the original creation contract; the omitted-alias counterfactual retains stale spatial slots and certifies no fidelity. Full gameplay RemoveUnit callback graph and survivor arrival remain open.
- [x] **GROUP-04.4** Complete a member at an original callback boundary, then compose the surviving mixed-speed cohort through natural arrival and cleanup; verify repeat raw trajectories and integrate active membership/speed into Move. Evidence: [completion/survivor journeys](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#callback-completion-surviving-cohort-and-empty-teardown), two frozen fixtures, four trigger/victim cases each repeated twice and178 exact C commits; [engine cohort correction](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#active-move-cohort-speed) reproduces six stale-cap failures before fixing them and covers identity wrap, edict reuse and save/load. Fixed-goal survivor offsets/destinations stay unchanged; actual refresh/reuse composition and full engine phases are explicitly split below.
- [x] **GROUP-04.5** After GROUP-04.1/03/04, compose actual formation refresh and new survivor destinations after callback mutation, using the original mover reclamation/reuse composition in04.8. Run original owner decisions/commits through survivor natural arrival and cleanup, preserving removed/reused Unit/Move/order ownership and repeat raw trajectories. Evidence: [actual point replacement/refresh](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#actual-survivor-point-replacement-and-formation-refresh), two frozen four-case matrices,638 exact production commits,120/120 strict corpus outcomes and a server-frame engine regression. New point requests create a fresh singleton group; mere removal retains the old slot. Same-group moving-target refresh remains TARGET-02.1/02.2 and the full engine phases remain04.6.
- [ ] **GROUP-04.6** Replace the engine cohort scan/static queued cap with Move-owned persistent retail group/member storage, generation/ownership checks, eligibility flags/shared override, queued activation/detachment and separate all-member decisions then commits. Integrate verified refresh/new destinations, teardown and save/load; compare intermediate group state and complete trajectories under the original clock contract.
- [x] **GROUP-04.7** Allocate baseline individual paths through original14ec50/150d50 instead of direct registration. Replay frozen singleton, pair and all callback-reuse cases; assert owner958 live/allocation counts and recycled-header links during mover release/reallocation and final group release, without changing frozen raw motion expectations. Evidence: [owned-path factory accounting](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#owned-path-factory-accounting), unchanged frozen expectations and116/116 strict corpus outcomes. Native heap allocation/failure and the full Unit construction graph remain BASE-03.1/MAP-05.3.
- [x] **GROUP-04.8** Complete a member at the original region callback, destroy/reallocate its mover through original producers, then run the retained survivor through natural arrival and final cleanup. Cover both victim roles and callback positions on open/wall maps with repeated exact trajectories, old-generation rejection, path/mover/spatial accounting and Unit/Move/order ownership; Evidence: [completed-member reuse](retail-pathfinding-movement.md#completed-member-reuse-through-survivor-arrival), two frozen four-case matrices,178 exact production velocity commits and118/118 strict corpus outcomes. Retain04.5 for actual formation refresh/new destinations and BASE-03.1 for the gameplay RemoveUnit graph/replacement actor binding.

- [x] **GROUP-04.9** Explicitly split ordinary singleton point-group routing from04.6: retain the group5000-work adaptive plan separately from the member400/700-work paths, consume the verified distance selector, keep the public final goal active across natural intermediate zero-velocity commits, refill on the next owner update and preserve both stages through Save/Load and replacement cleanup. Evidence: [payoff36](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-oblique-move-retains-the-singleton-group-destination), repeated three public journeys with689 exact commits, including two intermediate stops; engine RED1533 word/count failures then exact normal-frame/260 saved continuation commits. Ghidra persists165e30 and group16ce10/1697a0/member16a790 destinations. Shared multi-member ownership, generations/flags/formation, all-member decision/commit phases, physical crowds and hierarchy invalidation remain04.6/TARGET/MAP.

- [x] **GROUP-04.10** Explicitly split ordinary public shared-pair movement from04.6: allocate Move-owned generation-retaining group/member rows, keep the native formation slots and separate all-member decisions/commits, consume exact shared-speed and nearest-route retry/forced-arrival behavior, preserve intermediate owner state and save/load, then compare every clock/pose/velocity/facing commit through both natural arrivals. Evidence: [payoff38](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-pair-movement-uses-a-shared-move-owner), repeated scene47 phases,115 exact engine commits and87 saved continuation commits. Release/debug RoC/TFT, production builds, the normal repository suite and strict corpus validation pass; Save74 and Ghidra annotations are synchronized. Selected/AI producers, queued activation, all eligibility/shared override/cooldown bits, callback mutation, inter-group scheduling, general crowds and scene construction remain04.6/GROUP-01.1/MAP.

- [x] **GROUP-04.11** Explicitly split ordinary public twelve-member class0 movement from04.6: consume formation-offset adaptive adjustment, temporary group-object suppression, committed-pose occupancy, shared fine-work FIFO/interval timing and next-step/partial retry ordering in production Move; compare every normal-frame position/velocity/facing/clock commit through all natural order completions and two saved continuations. Evidence: [payoff39](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#twelve-member-public-group-retains-fine-admission-and-committed-occupancy), two repeated original scene48 captures,1,953 exact engine commits and2,634 saved suffix commits; forced release/debug RoC/TFT, production builds, the normal repository suite,172 Python tests and fresh strict corpus checks pass. Save75 and persistent Ghidra roles/types are synchronized. Other classes/pools, selected/AI producers, queued activation, wider eligibility/override bits, inter-group scheduling, overlapping cell links and arbitrary map/scenery construction remain04.6/SCHED/MAP.

- [x] **GROUP-04.12** Explicitly split ordinary selected ground Move from04.6: recover the live player point producer, reuse Move-owned retained physical cohorts for two through twelve unqueued same-mask ground candidates, and compare actual clicked pair lifetimes through normal engine frames, natural completion and save/load. Evidence: [payoff41](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#selected-ground-move-uses-the-shared-physical-owner), native Win32 input/read-only Frida packet8/attach-before-admit/publication, two separately supplied input clocks,456 exact engine commits and304 saved suffix commits. The unchanged public-pair fixture also matches115 selected-producer commits and87 saved suffix commits. Saved Ghidra roles/types and strict corpus are synchronized. Shift, air/mixed masks, larger selections, wider candidate priority/callback mutation, enabled formation flags and AI producers remain04.6/GROUP-01.1/ORDER; arbitrary scene construction remains BASE/MAP.

- [x] **GROUP-04.13** Explicitly split the first selected ground Shift Move behind an active shared cohort from04.6: retain a common point and one new queued request identity, activate members at their individual natural arrivals, rebuild matching nearby physical membership in original order, preserve normal owner scheduling and save/load, and compare every original absolute clock/pose/velocity/facing word. Evidence: [payoff42](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#selected-shift-move-retains-request-ownership-through-staggered-arrival), two complete external Win32 Shift/read-only Frida captures, singleton then fresh pair,1020 exact normal-frame commits and684 saved suffix commits. Idle/mixed/additional queues, wider spatial neighbor policies, preferred-distance/range90/bypass flags, callbacks and arbitrary scene construction remain04.6/BASE/MAP.

- [x] **GROUP-04.14** Explicitly split selected ground Shift from idle from04.6: verify empty current heads immediately dispatch the newly appended order, start one shared physical Move owner for all idle candidates, and compare complete native packet9 journeys plus saved continuations. Evidence: [payoff43](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#selected-idle-shift-starts-the-shared-physical-owner-immediately), two independent external Win32/read-only captures,456 exact normal-frame commits and304 saved suffix commits; the old independent-walker path fails40 assertions. Additional/mixed queues, other masks, larger selections, full rejection/event/limit graphs, callbacks and arbitrary scene construction remain04.6/ORDER/BASE/MAP.
- [x] **GROUP-04.15** Explicitly split two pending selected ground Shift moves from04.6: preserve latest submitted unit request history across both FIFO activations, rebuild matching cohorts at staggered arrivals, retain creation-ordered owner generations through slot reuse, and seed formation origin at cohort creation. Evidence: [payoff44](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#two-pending-shift-moves-retain-submission-history-and-physical-generations), two independent native Win32/read-only captures,1110 exact normal-frame commits,864 saved suffix commits, seven strict fresh contracts and saved Ghidra role/ABI/xref/field readbacks. Save79 retains request history and creation sequences. Mixed active/idle or unrelated orders, repeated identical goals, other masks, larger selections, full rejection/event/limit graphs, wider neighbor policies, callbacks and arbitrary scene construction remain04.6/ORDER/BASE/MAP/SCHED.
- [x] **GROUP-04.16** Explicitly split mixed active/idle selected ground Shift from04.6: preserve the active head, immediately activate the idle peer under one submitted common context, and acquire or reject that peer at the later physical transition. Evidence: [payoff45](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-active-and-idle-shift-share-one-submitted-request), four complete native Win32/read-only captures,1510 exact normal-frame commits,1020 saved suffix commits, eight fresh strict contracts and saved Ghidra role/ABI/xref readbacks. Save79 remains unchanged. Unrelated current orders, other masks/air/larger selections, wider rejection/callback/history/limit graphs and arbitrary scene construction remain04.6/ORDER/BASE/MAP/SCHED. A target-object click is explicitly diagnostic outside this ground-point contract. Payoff46 strengthens this leaf with two distinct active singleton point owners, native searches0/1,1022 exact engine commits and844 saved suffix commits. Other combat/work/cast heads remain open; no new checkbox is added.






## FORM — Formation and regrouping

Evidence: [formation evidence][M]. Tools/artifacts: motion, refill; Frida capture.

### FORM-01 — Formation producers

- [x] **FORM-01.1** The authored formation-rank setter and rank bits are mapped and tested. Evidence: [formation rank][formation-rank]; this does not close live group creation or other policy flags.
- [x] **FORM-01.2** [Payoff108](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-authored-ranks-install-before-formation-layout): two complete public40-sample mixed-rank producers repeat191 ordered installation/bucket/layout observations. Six creation ranks0/1/2/3/0/1 produce buckets[0,4]/[1,5]/[2]/[3]; same-mover Chaos installs3 and changes the corresponding bucket, fresh rank3 separately installs3. Engine caches the installed rank before callbacks, refreshes on type rebind, consumes it in both layouts and persists/validates Save110. DLL-parsed spacing40b00001 fixes five public offset words; all twelve initial offsets match. Actual group regression first fails twelve coordinates, then passes with save/type regressions. Focused Classic/TFT90,455 assertions each, frozen repeat/source/negative checks, O0/O2 supplied/public C oracles and saved Ghidra mappings/labels accompany the change; broader refresh-to-motion and flag producers remain open.
- [x] **FORM-01.3** Trace spacing bit20 and remaining formation-policy flags to callers; publish one producer-built witness per reachable value. Payoff245 joins the unchanged peer inventory (12 captures/16 compositions), whole-image setter/reference scan and original spacing pairs to prior Alt, Captain, Cargo Drop, airborne Follow, angular and Root integrations. It fixes sentinel target requests before conversion, forced-range/heading behavior and route bypass, with two public retail repeats, an unhooked control,320 complete original facing queries and fresh/two cold-save physical turn continuations. Broader Attack admission/cooldown timing stays in existing TARGET/ORDER tasks. See [sentinel requests](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#sentinel-target-requests-turn-before-attacking-payoff245) and the [historical handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/FORM-01.3/HANDOFF.md).

### FORM-02 — Layout geometry

- [x] **FORM-02.1** 144 complete layouts and 48 refresh cases are recorded. Evidence: [formation layout][formation-layout]; mixed moving radii and untested size domains remain excluded.
- [x] **FORM-02.2** Run mixed-radius/oblique layouts with equal sort keys; assert assignments, row dimensions, centering and rotation. Evidence: [exact formation geometry](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ranked-formation-layout-reaches-group-orders),865 complete original/production C raw-word cases, including720 mixed moving/radius/rank/heading/tie/clock-domain cases. Larger caller domains and live group producer remain02.3/FORM-05.
- [x] **FORM-02.3** Test moving members and sizes at/beyond the twelve-member table boundary; establish the original caller precondition or exact supported behavior. **Payoff111:** two completed public moving-group producers at11/12/13/25 retain11/12/12/12 insertion-ordered members; all188 native offset words match production C. Actual engine JASS boundaries retain unadmitted orders and match94 layout words. Admission now owns its point, fixing21 reproduced destination failures. Saved Ghidra maps the caller bound and dynamic backing helpers. See [contract and scope](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#public-moving-formations-retain-a-twelve-member-request-boundary).
- [x] **FORM-02.4** Explicit engine integration split from02.2/03: consume the verified twelve-member layout in actual selection Move and Shift queues, using authored ranks, fine-grid radii, strict tie assignment and software centering/rotation. Evidence: [ranked group orders](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ranked-formation-layout-reaches-group-orders), actual three-member regression fails all six destination coordinates before the port and passes exact destination/queue words afterward. Selections above twelve retain the existing engine extension; the public producer bound is established in02.3; clock prediction, original heading producer and refresh-to-motion remain FORM-01/03.

### FORM-03 — Layout-to-motion chain

- [x] **FORM-03.1** Compose refresh, adaptive destination query, held-member classification, all decisions and commit in one unblocked group tick; assert intermediate offsets and speeds. **Payoff109:** four actual ordinary/Alt six-member ticks match all456 native scalar stage words; engine now classifies ordinary mixed ranks and executes the held stop/turn path. See [evidence and scope](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#ordinary-and-alt-formation-ticks-retain-the-actual-ui-policy).
- [x] **FORM-03.2** Repeat with one blocked offset and with cached versus fresh routes; assert held/released members and fallback destination. **Payoff110:** two completed public producers retain195 route-owner passes each; first slot falls back to25/21 after classification, four first-tick held members release on the cached visit. Engine stage ordering and stack-local predicted fine queries match360 words through fresh/cached ticks and save/load. See [scope and evidence](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-formation-slots-adjust-after-classification).

### FORM-04 — Regroup triggers

- [x] **FORM-04.1** Change target, membership and member size at fixed ticks; assert which change rebuilds layout/routes and its timeout in simulation time. **Payoff112:** repeated public ticks20 size/30 removal retain survivor cached layout/routes; point retarget50 creates a new five-member owner. One status0 coarse advance at1456 resets then lays out survivors;648 complete original timeout cases establish strict99/198/396 eligible-visit counters. Engine fixes stale arrival/pending held queues, passes public mutation/save and full boundary matrix. Saved Ghidra maps initialization versus regroup reset and exact heading helper ABI. Moving-widget target producer domains remain in TARGET/GROUP; see [contract and scope](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fixed-tick-formation-mutation-and-regroup-preserve-cached-state).
- [x] **FORM-04.2** Cause route failure and a warp-marker transition; assert regroup trigger, cached-state invalidation and next layout. Payoff164/165 integrate admission-denied refresh-before-stop, old-velocity integration, retained queues/layout and admitted replacement counter resets, plus retained coarse warp-marker publication and every member decision's classification mirror. Three complete archived Frida repeats freshly verify12 index-only portal transitions,180 post-warp marked commits and cooldown visits3/69/135; two crowd repeats verify4166 denied visits each and723 retained-member recovery layouts. Failing-first actual engine group/held/server-frame/cold-save/recovery regressions pass; Save134 persists both route marker owners and Ghidra/mapper evidence is saved. Full mixed-selection motion remains FORM-05.1/05.2. See [formation warp markers](retail-pathfinding-formation-warp.md).

### FORM-05 — Retail formation witnesses

- [x] **FORM-05.1** Capture one mixed-unit selection order and independently issued controls with the same map/seed; compare group IDs, assignments, caps and trajectories. Payoff170 integrates independent public Move through physical singleton owners and confines row eligibility to the multi-member classification postpass. Two selected phases plus independent controls match2399 owner visits/5369 member commits; cold saves preserve1919 visits/4289 commits. See [selection and independent ownership](retail-pathfinding-formation-selection.md).
- [x] **FORM-05.2** Send that selection through a narrow passage and regroup; compare offsets/rebuild timing with the composed fixture.

## SEP — Repulsion and spatial records

Evidence: [separation evidence][P]. Tools/artifacts: separation, spatial, motion.

SEP-01.4 explicitly splits settings/authored category prerequisites from01.2.
SEP-02.4/05 split numerical engine integration and saved lifecycle from02.2/03;
complete neighbor traversal, ordering and original full application remain required.

### SEP-01 — Repulsion producers

- [x] **SEP-01.1** Authored Footman-disabled/Gryphon-enabled controls distinguish path blocking from opt-in repulsion. Evidence: [repulsion controls][repulsion]; mixed policy combinations remain open.
- [ ] **SEP-01.2** Trace nonzero config selectors and category/rank/mask overrides from authored/runtime producers; publish eligible/disabled cases for each. Payoff147 removes the invalid movement-eligibility gate from repulsor creation:432 complete native predicate cases, repeated integer-authored zero-speed ground/fly public controls,859 observer-free markers and engine owner/pause/save regression. Payoff201 integrates the Mechanical Critter gameplay override through real item use, purpose33 selection in UnitUI order, persistent Bmec ownership, public buff removal and saved latent-category refresh. Counted suppression remains open. See [Mechanical Critter](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mechanical-critter-retains-a-latent-separation-category-payoff201). See [independent separation owners](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#zero-speed-units-retain-independent-separation-owners). Payoff204 integrates immediate pending-removal unlink and refresh suppression using the existing generation-checked removal lifetime. Two complete enabled retail repeats and one observer-free control agree; engine callback/list/owner/pause/duplicate/save regressions pass. Final native retirement briefly recreates separation and remains explicitly excluded. See [removal boundary](retail-pathfinding-removal.md).
- [x] **SEP-01.3** Exercise the resulting policy table across supported movement types and owners; assert candidate eligibility before displacement. Payoff127 integrates the repeated36-case live matrix,65,536 original packed-policy cases and valid-state inert-row controls. Production regressions check eligibility independently of selector arithmetic across foot/fly/hover/amph/horse and owners0/1/2/15, then channel/type/pause/save transitions. Move now retires/recreates repulsors at channel and type changes; repulseParam is parsed as an integer without lossy conversion. Extra flag/work producers remain SEP-01.2. See [engine integration](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#separation-policy-refresh-follows-channel-and-type-lifecycle). Research handoff: [SEP-01.3](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/SEP-01.3/HANDOFF.md).

- [x] **SEP-01.4** Split the shipped settings/category prerequisites from01.2: execute the full004790 initializer with pinned CRT, record all16 rows, verify actual CUnit owner getter/category1024 cases, persist Ghidra structures/names/ABI and integrate authored selector/group/rank into Move. Evidence: [engine repulsion port](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-repulsion-reaches-idle-engine-units), custom configuration1/group19/rank3 SLK regression. Runtime override/extra disable semantics remain01.2; all movement/owner policy matrix remains01.3.

### SEP-02 — Separation composition

- [x] **SEP-02.1** Post-arrival pair: 16 ticks, 14 attempts, ten accepted and four blocked. Evidence: [pair][pair], M `move_owner_separation_cases`; controlled profile and bounded numeric tolerance.
- [x] **SEP-02.2** Record and independently compare every neighbor contribution for a three-object query through accumulation, clamp/cooldown and application. Payoff132: complete original/live replay and actual engine3,055 updates/2,439 individual contributions across nine clusters, ordered proximity membership and Save119 regressions; [evidence](retail-pathfinding-proximity.md). Research handoff: [SEP-02.2](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/SEP-02.2/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **SEP-02.3** After NUM-04, include an exact-overlap pair in that query; assert PRNG draws, endpoint result and actual occupancy changes across subsequent ticks. Research handoff: [SEP-02.3](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/SEP-02.3/HANDOFF.md). Payoff133: complete production owner passes, unchanged full overlap fixtures, individual shared RNG/pair/admission/occupancy checks; [engine payoff](retail-pathfinding-overlap.md).

- [x] **SEP-02.4** Split ordered numerical pair/tail integration from02.2/03: original600 pair105 tail slices match production C exactly, including owner random overlap; port actual idle owner scheduling and pending fine endpoint application with Footman-disabled control. First overlap pending displacement/random words match through engine RunFrame. Full retail neighbor-chain composition remains02.2/03.
- [x] **SEP-02.5** Persist repulsion vectors/cooldown/policy and relocated membership/parity; verify actual idle overlap continuation after Save66, public owner transfer, pause and deferred removal. Evidence: [72 engine assertions and Save66](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#authored-repulsion-reaches-idle-engine-units). Multi-neighbor query stamps/order remainSEP-03.

### SEP-03 — Spatial records

- [x] **SEP-03.1** Insert/remove movers in two orders; assert cell chain order, metadata/dead records and cleanup threshold/sampling cadence. Payoff136: both actual fine/proximity maps retain newest-first pooled records, delta-strip updates, removals/dead identities and real fine metadata; independent ordered software1/10 maintenance, exact2100-to36 cleanup, saved stamps and engine load/order regressions. [Integration](retail-pathfinding-storage.md#payoff136-fine-map-integration).
- [x] **SEP-03.2** Cross query stamp wrap/repair and a fresh block allocation; assert candidate order and block reclamation after removal. Payoff136: original full stamp/pool/storage differential and repeated controlled AB/BA captures; engine65-object block/address/LIFO checks, retained owner-slot identities and labelled high-bit unlink alias. Both maps use the shared exact core; [limits](retail-pathfinding-storage.md#payoff136-fine-map-integration).
- [x] **SEP-03.3** Force spatial allocation failure/growth during an update; assert no partial membership and the original movement outcome. Payoff136: fresh original36-cell growth/pregrow controls match frozen results, actual fine publication crosses131072 links mid-update with every entered cell retained, and injected engine growth allocation failure terminates before returning partial membership. NULL-return/zero-growth interventions remain labelled. [Evidence](retail-pathfinding-storage.md#payoff136-fine-map-integration).

### SEP-04 — Retail separation witnesses

- [x] **SEP-04.1** Replay one live exact-overlap case with recorded seed and neighbors; match contributions, cooldown and trajectory. Research handoff: [SEP-04.1](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/SEP-04.1/HANDOFF.md). Payoff133: complete production owner passes, unchanged full overlap fixtures, individual shared RNG/pair/admission/occupancy checks; [engine payoff](retail-pathfinding-overlap.md).
- [x] **SEP-04.2** Complete mixed-owner/radius/rank/selector wall crowd matches2,255 real owner visits,3,228 ordered contributions and76 retries, exact endpoint/pose/RNG/occupancy plus public positions. Saved mid-order suffix also matches; four blocked orders remain unfinished and first blocking identity remains inferred. See [Payoff144](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-crowds-individual-physical-owners-and-adjusted-retries-payoff144); [research handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/SEP-04.2/HANDOFF.md).
- [x] **SEP-04.3** Enabled/disabled ground controls match1,336 real owner visits,1,182 contributions and66 retries through closed-ring/gap movement and Stop; disabled sources retain collision/routing. Saved continuation and public outputs match. Shared adjusted retry goal and physical singleton scheduling replace incorrect engine ordering. See [Payoff144](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#mixed-crowds-individual-physical-owners-and-adjusted-retries-payoff144); [research handoff](retail-pathfinding-handoffs/SEP-04.3/HANDOFF.md).

## GATE — Way Gates

Evidence: [gate evidence][L] and [routes][R]. Tools/artifacts: transition, adaptive; Frida capture.

### GATE-01 — Gate eligibility and exit

- [x] **GATE-01.1** Test activation/approach threshold equality and adjacent values with eligible/ineligible movers; assert route consumer decisions. [Payoff100](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#adaptive-eligibility-survives-flight-birth-and-changes-on-type-rebind) separates birth and type-rebind adaptive policy from movement class. Two completed public repeats match383 full production commits and2811 saved continuations. All320 unchanged original consumer controls match O0/O2, including equality, adjacent values, active-bit eligibility and retained rejection status2. Both editions, fourteen strict contracts and saved Ghidra setter/field/ABI readback pass.
- [x] **GATE-01.2** Block the exit and test outside-map/unreachable destinations; assert placement rejection, fallback or failure and retained route state. [Payoff97](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#blocked-gate-exits-preserve-stopped-retry-state) corrects placement filter32/budget24/six-ring admission and retained crossing retry before every fine refill. Two repeated public journeys include a nearby admitted exit, surrounded failure, unblocking and both outside-map signs. Production matches1280 complete motion commits and10338 saved continuations; failure preserves index2 through all eight retries. Both editions, strict captures and saved placement-context/ABI readback pass.

### GATE-02 — Gate mutation

- [x] **GATE-02.1** Live outside approach, cached retarget and disable-to-walking witnesses are recorded. Evidence: [gate mutation][gate-mutation]; fresh retarget/destroy/impassable cases remain open.
- [x] **GATE-02.2** Destroy a gate during approach; assert stale-record handling and subsequent walking/failure. [Payoff96](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#way-gate-destruction-preserves-deferred-id-ownership) matches all813 production commits across two complete destruction/replacement journeys and3449 saved continuations. Removed ID1 is skipped after cleanup; immediate replacement allocates2 and walks. Both pairs of original captures retain complete pool/marker/route state and exact motion; full editions,586 Python checks,production,five strict contracts and saved Ghidra pass. Getters inside RemoveUnit callbacks and all deferred scheduler boundaries are excluded.
- [x] **GATE-02.3** Retarget then issue a fresh order; compare cached versus fresh destination use through final arrival. [Payoff95](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#way-gate-special-edges-reach-retained-move-routes) integrates current ability-owned active records and retained-route cached exits into Move. Two completed public journeys repeat cached54.5/55.5 versus fresh39.5/45.5 fine exits and disabled walking through final arrival:407 decisions,410 commits,11 requests/routes,six consumers,two warps. The production game matches every clock/position/velocity/facing word; ten save checkpoints reproduce3094 continuation commits. Both editions,582 Python checks,production,five fresh strict contracts and saved Ghidra pass. Destroy/reuse,blocked exit,impassable disable and paired groups retain their existing leaves.
- [x] **GATE-02.4** Disable the only edge across impassable terrain; assert retries/failure rather than assuming walking succeeds. [Payoff98](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#group-gate-continuation-and-consecutive-portal-admission) exercises two members against a full-height unwalkable column after disabling the sole crossing. The actual partial-route retry and forced-arrival lifecycle matches all635 native commits and6025 restored continuations. The harness initializes the production locked-map random owner; no production seed or route case is hardcoded. Complete original repeats, both editions and strict member-identity checks pass.

### GATE-03 — Multiple gates

- [x] **GATE-03.1** Construct two overlapping sources in both orders; assert marker overwrite, cleanup and hierarchy propagation. [Payoff94](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#way-gate-overlap-publishes-ordinary-routing-history) ports eight native publication states,64 exact ordinary searches and24 unequal-origin/reversed/clipped/zero/odd-boundary controls. Two complete public witnesses repeat all marker/parent bytes. Real ability removal and group requests reproduce overwrite and unconditional erasure; Save99 retains both erased overlaps and published parent history. Both editions,579 Python checks, production, six fresh strict contracts and saved Ghidra roles/ABIs pass. Portal traversal and retained special-edge consumers remain separate.
- [x] **GATE-03.2** Run chained gates with active/inactive combinations and equal-cost alternatives; assert route choice and consumer event order. [Payoff99](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#group-gate-continuation-and-consecutive-portal-admission) adds immediate coarse-route progress before fine refill, reproducing both active, A off, B off and both off chains through all575 motion commits and4564 saved continuations. The unchanged native multi-gate search/distance oracle matches512 full requests and eight publications. Equal-cost A/B alternatives select ID1 with both active independently of publication order; route nodes, points, distances and event order are exact. Both editions, fresh strict contracts and saved Ghidra pass.

### GATE-04 — Gate ID lifetime

- [x] **GATE-04.1** Allocate through IDs1..255 and one further request; assert zero/exhaustion behavior and pool state. Evidence: [payoff93](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#way-gate-exhaustion-retains-ability-owned-allocation), unchanged original256 initial calls/duplicate activation/invalid and duplicate releases/refills17/255/0,259 exact C allocations and full availability bytes atO0/O2, two complete public259-birth witnesses with776 repeated semantic events. Engine CAbilityWarp retains failed allocation, zero/false getters, independent alternate presentation, semantic removal/reuse and ability recreation; Save98 round trips256 gates and rejects duplicate/invalid ownership. Both editions, production,575 Python checks and six fresh strict contracts pass; Ghidra roles/types/ABIs are saved. Existing-route reuse remains04.2, source overlap03.1, portal search/physical traversal01/03/04.3.
- [x] **GATE-04.2** Free/reuse an ID referenced by an existing route; assert revalidation and destination selection. [Payoff96](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#way-gate-destruction-preserves-deferred-id-ownership) contrasts same-callback ID2 allocation before ID1 release against next-callback ID1 reuse. The current active bit is revalidated, while the cached54.5/55.5 exit survives replacement record19/22 and changed source. The new production lifetime boundary repairs the former commit297 divergence. All299 delayed-reuse and514 immediate-replacement commits plus3449 saved suffixes match; both editions and strict public contracts pass.
- [x] **GATE-04.3** Traverse a gate with a group, then fail/skip it; assert regrouping and ordinary fine-route continuation. [Payoff98](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#group-gate-continuation-and-consecutive-portal-admission) follows both members through active crossing, Stop/reset and cached disabled-edge skip. The open map walks/regroups; the sole-edge wall control follows ordinary partial-route retry. Production matches1245 full motion commits and11775 restored continuations from24 saves. Strict capture mappings reject unknown, missing or swapped member identities; both editions and full route/consumer repeats pass.

## E2E — Combined scenarios and handoff

Evidence: [all contracts][ledger]. Tools/artifacts: corpus manifest/runner and normalized comparison artifacts from BASE.

### E2E-01 — Cross-feature baseline variants

- [x] **E2E-01.1** After BASE-06.5, freeze static-detour and disconnected-goal variants; assert route, partial/failure events and final ownership. Payoff203 freezes the three-variant contract and verifies37 complete constructed routes/230 point pairs, exact partial results/charged work, two actual blocked retry returns, all motion/save suffixes and final order ownership twice in Classic/TFT. The original BASE-06.5 and detour execute fresh; complete public blocked/disconnected Frida repeats are revalidated unchanged. The controlled detour retains its explicit admission/profile exclusions; no new live or full-RNG claim. See [cross-feature baselines](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md).
- [x] **E2E-01.2** Add dynamic blocker and pursuit variants to that manifest; reuse ROUTE-03/TARGET-02 evidence and compare intermediate state. Payoff206 binds the completed ROUTE-03/ROUTE-05 dynamic/yield streams and TARGET-02 ground Smart/TARGET-03 fog arrival to the static baseline. Three original capture contracts execute fresh; eight actual game fresh/save journeys repeat twice in Classic/TFT (854,608 assertions per edition), checking every observed intermediate field and preserving active-order/cannot-path limits. Eight original source pins remain unchanged. See [dynamic and pursuit variants](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#dynamic-blocker-and-pursuit-variants-payoff206).
- [x] **E2E-01.3** Add contention, cancellation and next-order variants; reuse SCHED-04/ORDER-06 evidence and assert event/queue order. [Payoff210](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#contention-cancellation-and-successors-share-the-end-to-end-baseline-payoff210): three categories/ten actual game journeys repeat twice per edition. Original Scheduler102 complete repeats retain25,902 events/288 paths and the one pending request at the marker;516 owner-window rows remain unchanged. Cancel208/Interrupt209/Patrol176 contracts, saved queues/RNG, callback replacement and arrival/combat/blocked successors pass with their original exclusions. The nested journey harness now performs registered VM/trigger resets; no numerical fixture is rewritten.
- [x] **E2E-01.4** Add formation/crowd and gate variants; link FORM-05/SEP-04/GATE evidence and freeze expected cross-feature outputs. Payoff205 binds the FORM-05 selected/independent/passage, SEP-04 mixed/disabled controls and GATE open/disabled/disconnected/chained contracts to the static baseline. Six original contracts execute fresh and eight actual game fresh/save journeys repeat twice in Classic/TFT (2,117,900 assertions per edition). Existing original fixtures remain unchanged; four blocked crowd orders remain unfinished. See [combined variants](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#formation-crowd-and-gate-variants-payoff205).

### E2E-02 — Observer controls

- [x] **E2E-02.1** Open-ground no-attach control matches 304 markers twice; blocked-goal305, replacement311, fog610 and building310 match once. Evidence: [observer controls][observer]; crowd/mode repeats remain open.
- [ ] **E2E-02.2** Repeat blocked-goal, replacement, fog and building controls from the recorded manifests; assert matching completion markers and normalized outcomes.
- [ ] **E2E-02.3** Run equivalent minimal-hook/no-hook crowd and additional movement-mode controls; compare timing and complete trajectories, retaining mismatches.

### E2E-03 — Deterministic generated cases

- [ ] **E2E-03.1** Repeat each frozen scenario with the same seed twice; fail on any unexplained normalized state/event difference.
- [ ] **E2E-03.2** Generate a fixed-seed boundary corpus over supported lanes/radii/goals; minimize each mismatch and commit its input plus retail explanation.

### E2E-04 — Long-run composition

- [x] **E2E-04.1** Compose verified stamp/counter/handle/gate-ID wrap and reuse cases into repeated movement; assert no stale ownership or changed route policy. [Payoff212](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#active-movement-across-wrap-and-reuse-boundaries-payoff212) composes four actual-game categories twice per Classic/TFT, with ten unchanged original contracts revalidated fresh. Active Gate96 counter/stamp jumps preserve every motion word and ten saved continuations per journey; retained search storage, group/edict/release ownership and exhausted gate IDs preserve their verified policies. Native stamp aliases remain explicit; forced jumps are not claimed as natural gameplay.
- [x] **E2E-04.2** Compose reload/save-load, callback removal and pool pressure cases with active orders; assert final idle state and uninterrupted-control differences. [Payoff213](retail-pathfinding-e2e-baselines.md#active-orders-across-reload-callbacks-and-pool-pressure-payoff213) composes two actual MPQ worlds, active orders, 129-order callback pressure and cold saves on both sides of removal; all motion/ownership words reach final idle, with fresh maintenance serials and native rebuilt-chain differences explicit. Four categories repeat twice per Classic/TFT and five unchanged original contracts revalidate fresh. Adaptive scratch no longer frees live spatial membership; cold load registers completed maintenance owners once.

### E2E-05 — Unknowns audit

- [ ] **E2E-05.1** Join the BASE-03 inventory to reports and task IDs; emit a concrete list of remaining flags, prefixes, stubs, tolerances and excluded branches.
- [ ] **E2E-05.2** Resolve each listed row with evidence or documented unreachability; create bounded child tasks for unresolved rows instead of one open-ended investigation.

### E2E-06 — Implementation specification

- [ ] **E2E-06.1** Freeze structures, units, coordinate/lane/footprint and numeric/PRNG contracts with links to runnable evidence.
- [x] **E2E-06.2** Frozen ordinary state/result, update/event-order, ownership and invalidation contracts with explicit limits/failure behavior and evidence links. Payoff83 resolves the MAP-03.3 terrain-edit/regional hierarchy timing, retains active paths, restores the original full post-main publication and saves independently published classes in Save93. Two complete repeated public captures and both-edition RunFrame/save continuations check every observed fine/hierarchy value and all724 motion commits. Evidence: [state contract](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#pathing-update-state-and-ownership-contract), [engine payoff](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#fine-terrain-edits-retain-regional-hierarchy-publication); wider categorical/reentrant/allocation scopes retain FOOT-03/MAP-04/05/06.

### E2E-07 — OpenRealm integration design

- [x] **E2E-07.1** Mapped Move-owned routing/steering, primary/owner clocks, order dispatch, world/collision, static publication and save entry points to named files/call sites. Payoff83 implements the typed game-private publication/save interfaces and include-local map initialization hook; no client/network gameplay policy is added. Evidence: [replacement interfaces](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#openrealm-replacement-interfaces-and-lifecycle-boundaries).
- [x] **E2E-07.2** Specified route/group/shared-owner allocations, incarnation/generation references, queue ownership, serialization, backing rebuild and cleanup at the Quake2 game-module/function-table boundary. Payoff83 distinguishes disposable search backing from authoritative published hierarchy state and verifies saved continuation without republishing pending terrain. Evidence: [ownership and cleanup](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#openrealm-replacement-interfaces-and-lifecycle-boundaries), [Save93](save-load.md); original full teardown/reentrant composition retains existing MAP/E2E-04 tasks.

### E2E-08 — Differential adapter design

- [x] **E2E-08.1** Payoff115 implements identical four-lifetime movement inputs, producer-lifetime identities and ordered committed clock/pose/velocity/heading outputs; accepted Frida B/C captures and fresh actual-game Classic/TFT journals match the encoded baseline. Full task/route/RNG output expansion remains separate. See [differential adapters](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#exact-public-game-differential-adapters).
- [x] **E2E-08.2** Payoff115 requires exact simulation words/types/cardinality/order and bounds the explicitly uncompared presentation schema. Deliberate mutations of every baseline word, clocks, input, identity, event count/order and signed zero fail with JSON-pointer/hex/event diagnostics. Fresh-output and zero-exit failed-test controls also reject. See [comparison contract](retail-pathfinding-engine.md#exact-public-game-differential-adapters).

## READY — Start the faithful replacement

Evidence: [scope and contracts][ledger]. Tools/artifacts: frozen corpus, coverage inventory and integration design.

### READY-01 — Evidence coverage gate

- [ ] **READY-01.1** Run the coverage inventory audit: every in-scope branch/exclusion has evidence or a proved-unreachable disposition; zero unassigned behavior gaps.

### READY-02 — Behavior gate

- [ ] **READY-02.1** Run all frozen success/failure and cross-feature scenarios; zero unexplained differences, with retail quirks and numerical thresholds retained as regressions.

### READY-03 — Reproduction gate

- [ ] **READY-03.1** Run the corpus from documented inputs in a fresh output directory; build/hash/seed/observer controls and completion markers all pass.

### READY-04 — Implementation handoff gate

- [ ] **READY-04.1** Review the complete replacement specification and OpenRealm interfaces against the baseline; record no remaining decisions that require guessing. This is the final full-replacement gate; incremental engine integration is already authorized and must continue alongside RE.
